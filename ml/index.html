        "content": "Life displays great diversity with 10 million or more species. The unity and the diversity of life are explained by evolution.\nIntroduction to Evolution What is Evolution? Basic Definition:\nChange through time Decent with motification Darwin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Pangenesis\u0026rdquo;: proposal that each part of the body continually emits small particles called gemmules that contribute to the heritable information to the gametes Biological Definition:\nChange in allele or genotype frequencies in populations over time Note:\nEvolution occurs in populations Evolution does not occur in an individual Adaptive Radiation Organism diversify rapidly from an acestral species when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niche e.g. Hawaiian Drosophila radiation: alleles and genotypes of Drosophila shift through times as volcanic islands form, are observed through phenotypes, and evolve by natural selection How does Evolution affect our lives? Penicillin\nProduct of Penicillium mold (Alexander Fleming, 1928) Represents an evolved response to bacteria First antibiotic drug based on a naturally occuring substance Four years of of use -\u0026gt; Staphylococcus strains resistant went up to 14% By 1950, resistant became more than 50% Penicillin: today\nContinue to develop new strains of penicillin Identify and locate resistance Need to minimize dependence on antibiotics Resistant bacteria still kills 30,000 to 40,000 Americans each year COVID-19\nMutations lead to variations, which can exceptionally be problematic Properties of variants: virulence , dispersal, symptoms Micro vs Macro Microevolution\nChanges within a species Caused by natural selection or evolutionary forces Depends on heritable variation in genetics of a population Traits can be under strong natural selection e.g. antibiotic resistance Macroevolution\nChanges between species Microevolution Phenotypic Variation Heritable variation in appearance and/or function\nQualitative variation:\nDiscrete characteristics Polymorphism: distinct variatns of character e.g. two-spot ladybug Quantitative variation:\nContinuous and measurable characteristics Controlled by multiple genes e.g. height Examples of Phenotypic Variation\nEuropean Garden Snails vary in colour as there is no selective pressure acting on it. In a hypothetical situation, the population can converge towards a brown-coloured snails if the predators evolve to detect the bright colours better. Bahamian Land Snails are under a strong selective pressure, having only a few, non-distinguishable phenotypic variation. Factors of the Phenotypic Variation\nPhenotypic variation is due to genetics (genotype), environment, or both Only genetic component of phenotype are heritable Phenotypic Variation Experiment Keep Genetics constant (e.g. clone), Vary Environment The clour of Hydrangeas vary depending on the pH of soil (acidic: blue, basic: pink) Breeding and Selection Important as evolution can only act on heritable variation Artificially selected mouse with higher activity level (experimental lines) and compared with control lines (no artificial selection) -\u0026gt; found out that there was underlying genetic variation for activity level Mandelian genetics Genetic Variation Causes\nNew alleles from mutations Recombination: from crossing over, independent assortment, random fertilization Types\nGerm-line mutations: occur in the reproductive cells -\u0026gt; inherited Somatic mutations: occur in the non-reproductive cells -\u0026gt; does not get inherited Population Genetics The study of patterns in genetic variation in populations\nIndividuals within a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur Individuals within a population are closely related to each other than members of other populations Different populations of the same species may be isolated from each other such that gene flow is rare Gene Pool\nSum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population Characterizes a population\u0026rsquo;s genetic makeup Used to identify the genotypes and calculate genotype frequencies Given that species is diploids and have two alleles of each gene, we can calculate allele frequencies Evolutionary Agents Genotypes and Alleles Genotype frequency: the % of individuals in a population with a specific genotype -\u0026gt; shows the distribution of allele combinations in a population Allele frequency: the % of all copies of a certain gene in a population that carry a specific allele -\u0026gt; shows the distribution of genetic variation in a population Evolution is measured as changes in allele frequencies in populations Computing Frequencies Notations $$p=\\text{frequency of one allele}$$ $$q=\\text{frequency of another allele}$$ $$p+q=1 \\text{ (normalization)}$$\nGenotype Frequencies of the Next Genetation\nAssuming that the population is in equilibrium for the C locus, we have $$(p+q)\\times(p+q)=p^2+2pq+q^2$$ where $$p^2= (\\text{frequency of }C^RC^R)$$ $$2pq= (\\text{frequency of }C^RC^W)$$ $$q^2= (\\text{frequency of }C^WC^W)$$\nExample\nConisder Snapdragons that exhibit incomplete dominance with distinctive phenotype of heterozygotes Let $p=0.7, q=0.3$ Then, expected genotype frequencies in the next generation are $$p^2= 0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.49$$ $$2pq= 2 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.42$$ $$q^2= 0.3 \\times 0.3 = 0.09$$ Predicted countings are 490, 420, and 90. Actual countings are 410, 423, and 167, respectively Thus, we can conclude that one of the Hardy-Weinberg principles is violated and the population is evolving with the selective force towards the $C^W$ allele. The Hardy-Weinberg Principle Null model: assume the absence of evolutionary change and compare it to the real population Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: describes a population where the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remains constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mandelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium occurs when the following conditions are met: No mutation No gene flow: population is closed to migration from other populations Infinite population No natural selection: all genotypes survive and reproduce equally Random mating: individuals mate randomly with respect to genotypes Microevolutionary Agents Mutation: a heritable change in DNA -\u0026gt; introduces new genetic variation into population Rare event, significant over long time scales Deleterious or lethal mutations are harmful but may persist if recessive Neutral mutations are neither harmful or helpful e.g. slient mutation that does not alter amino acids Advantageous mutations benefit an organism e.g. novel host adaptation Gene flow: change in allele frequencies as individuals join a population and reproduce -\u0026gt; may introduce genetic variation from another population may be the movement of individuals e.g. seeds or gametes e.g. pollen Genetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies caused by chance events -\u0026gt; reduces genetic variation (can eliminate in small populations) Population bottelneck: caused by catastrophic factors: diseases, starvation, drought -\u0026gt; reduce genetic variation Founders effect: migrating population may not have the entire genetic variation of the parent population Natural selection: differential survivorship or reproduction of individuals with different genotypes -\u0026gt; one allele may increase in frequency Relative fitness is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contribution of others Natural selection can be measured by fitness Directional selection: favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum Stabilizing selection: favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes Disruptive selection: favours individuals with extreme phenotypes Nonrandom mating: choice of mates based on their phenotypes and genotypes -\u0026gt; does not directly affect allele frequencies but prevent genetic equilibrium Variation Selection on variation Example\nGoldenrod gall fly, Tephritidae Chemically alter the plant stems to produce a larva inside a gall Selection factors: A parasitic wasp, Eurytoma gigantea, use hormone to find the gall and inject their eggs -\u0026gt; hatches, eats the larvae, steals the protection Note that larger sized galls are not attacked effectively as a parasitic wasp is small -\u0026gt; selection towards large gall A downy woodpecker, Picoides pubescens, is also a predator of the golden gall larvae Note that large galls are attacked more as the woodpeckers cannot perch on the small galls -\u0026gt; selection towards small gall When these two predators are present, stabilizing selection occurs and the gall size converges towards the mean Sexual selection Competition for mates A type of a natural selection Sexual Cannibalism\nAdaptive male strategy Happens if benefits of being eaten \u0026gt; male\u0026rsquo;s expected future reproductive value Benefits of being eaten Increased paternity Decreased likelihood of female remating Gray Tree Frogs\nFemales prefer males with long calls Tadpole survival: long call \u0026gt; short call Tadpole growth: long call \u0026gt; short call Time to metamorphosis : long call \u0026lt; short call Why is there still variation when selection is so strong?\nNot all females have strong preferences Females cannot always mate the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; male Note that relative fitness is not absolute Balancing selection Various forms of selection that lead to the active maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations Alleles are said to be \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; when a stable equilibrium state is reached If allele frequencies are perturbed from this equilibrium, selection will return them back to that state Balanced polymorphisms\nHeterozygote Advantage a state where heterozygotes are preferred over homozygotes\nSickle cell anemia and malaria Sickled cells clog the arteries but are beneficial at fighting against malaria Thus, HbA/Hba heterozygote that produces both normal and sickled forms of hemoglobin is preferred Negative Frequency-dependent Selection high fitness when rare\nPerissodus are either right-mouthed or left-mouthed If right-jawed fish is common, Perissodus evolves to be left-mouthed So the fish evolves to be left-jawed, causing Perissodus to evolve right-mouthed Adaptation Adaptive traits: products of selection that increase relative fitness Adaptation: Accumulation of adaptive traits over time Adaptation hypotheses must be tested Current structures came from existing structures Some traits arise by chance and not selection Nautral selection Note that natural selection does not necessarily lead to an absolute optimal solution Simply prefers a competitive optimum Why there is no perfect oraganism?\nSelection can only act on existing variation Adaptations are often compromises Environments change over time and have competing selection pressures Adaptations lag environmental change The traits observed in a population today are the result of natural selection acting in the past Chance, natural selection, the environment all interact Darwin (Macroevolution) Controversy of evolution Before Darwin, when natural theology was prevalent, it was believed that all organisms are perfectly designed to fit in the environment through God\u0026rsquo;s divine guidance Some appreciation that nature changes Comparative morphology revealed structural similarities in dissimilar anatomies Currently useless structures, vestigial structures were found Fossils Startification\nHorizontal layering of sedimentary rocks Different fossils in different layers Fossils suggested extinction Paleobiology\nStudy of ancient organisms Catastrophism\nTheory of fossil formation by catastrophe Jean-Baptiste Lamarck Made important contributions to evolution thinking\nSpecies change over time and pass on changes Organisms respond to the environment Hypothesized an incorrect mechanism Principle of use and disuse and subsequent inheritance It\u0026rsquo;s not the organism\u0026rsquo;s will, but the environment that takes charge in selection Darwin Went to medical school but did not like it Became friends with a professor Robert Grant, who changed from medical school to natural history Became friends with a Guyanese taxidermist John Edmunstone and learned taxidermy Father sent Darwin to Christ\u0026rsquo;s College to become a minister Became friends with a professor John Henslow, talking about nature -\u0026gt; Suggested Darwin the idea of exploration Met Adam Sedgwick and became interested in the history of the earth Met a captain Robert Fitzroy and got on the boat (his father paid) Charles Lyell encouraged Darwin to make his first publication Darwin frustrated by the prevalent idea in the society regarding racism and promoting inequality Darwin was discouraged to share his \u0026ldquo;dangerous idea\u0026rdquo; Darwin\u0026rsquo;s daughter Annie died -\u0026gt; Darwin decided to get his idea out in the world Letter from Alfred Russel Wallace with the similar idea Alfred and Darwin co-authored a paper \u0026ldquo;The Origin of Species\u0026rdquo; (1859) Descent with Modification: fossils of Patagonia as evidence, \u0026ldquo;principle of succession\u0026rdquo; Divergence in Isolation from a Common Ancestor: each island had similar physical conditions but distinct species of mockingbirds, tortoises, etc Darwin believed in monogenism, opposing polygenism (racial essentialism), but also was a ssexist Evidence Alfred Russel Wallace Worked with Darwin Activism for environmental issues Fire on ship, all specimens lost Found the striking pattern in the distribution of animals around the Malay archipelago Proposed an imaginary line dividing the region in two parts Came to conclusion that the fittest individuals survived and reproduced, passing their advantageous characteristics on to their offspring Evolution is a theory In science:\nTheory is not a guess or a hunch Theory is well-established, well-supported, well-documented explanations for our observations Laws describe, Theories explain\nMacroevolution Evolution\nThings evolve: populations change over time Evolution usually happens gradually: populations change over hundreds to thousands of years Speciation occurs: one species splits into two or more species All species share common ancestry: splitting of lineages from one ancestral form Much of evolutionary change caused by natural selection: the sole process producing adaptation, the \u0026lsquo;appearance\u0026rsquo; of design Predictions based on evolution\nIf life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, we should see evidence in the fossil record If evolution occured within lineages, and those linages sometimes split then we should see change in species or morphology through the fossil record If organisms share a common ancestry, then we should see transitional forms We should see evidence of retrodictions and vestigial characters We should be able to see evidence of natural selection Peter \u0026amp; Rosemary Grant Once professors at McGill, then Princeton Long-term fieldwork on the Galapagos Islands Natural selection in action Peter Boag Intended to do a study on the heritability of beak size by swapping eggs to control for parental care Finches Under normal circumstance\nMost finches eat a preferred 24 types of seeds G. fortis, a medium ground finch and G. magnirostris, a large ground finch have the identical preference Birds spent ~50% time foraging on their seven favourite seeds High abundance of seeds ($10g/m^2$) -\u0026gt; Less selection via competition After a massive drought\nBoag thought his thesis was ruined Food availability decreased by 84% Variety decreased by $\\frac{1}{2}$ Remaining seeds were big and tough Birds spent ~0.03% time foraging on favourites Soon after only a few types of seeds left Little to no mating opportunities Seed abundance decreased to $\u0026lt;3g/m^2$ Large fortis ate large seeds Medium fortis ate medium seeds Small fortis ate small seeds Birds were even forced to feed on the dreaded Tribulus Extremely sharp spines Mericarps are usually ignored by the finches Only fortis and magnirostris can break open it\u0026rsquo;s hard spines Different strategies for eating Tribulus\nMagnirostris Crushes seeds with its beek Requires $200N$ of force Can often eat all the seeds in one mericarp Gets 2.5x more energy per minute than medium ground finches but larger -\u0026gt; needs more energy Fortis Too small to crush the seeds Braces it against a rock to split it open Requires $54N$ of force Cost: feawer seeds obtained per mericarp Steal from magnirostris Small G. Fortis could not open Tribulus\nForced to feed on Chamaesyce Herb with small soft seeds Exudes a sticky, milky latex Latex gets stick to their heads Feathers on their heads fall off Bald birds die in the hot sun Beak depth variation in G. fortis Evolutionary response of G. fortis after the drought\nDecline in population size Decrease in seed abundance Increase in seed hardness -\u0026gt; increase in weight, wing length, tarsus length, bill length, bill depth, and bill width\nNote: Survival is not random. Larger birds are more likely to survive than the smaller birds\nSummary\nRole of adaptations (morphology and behaviour) may be evident only during times of stress and competition Without competition: Variation fills in Less selection on the adaptations With competition: adaptations become important increase in selection decrease in variation Genetics of beak morphology\nGene Bmp4 is responsible for beak depth Candidate gene from chicken Finches with deeper beaks have strong expression of Bmp4 Humans and Chimpanzees Chimpanzees are humans\u0026rsquo; most closely related species Humans have 23 chromosomes while Chimpanzees have 24 What happened to that chromosome?\nPrediction 1: It was lost, we didn\u0026rsquo;t need those genes (through natural selection) Prediction 2: A Creator distributed the genes differently, didn\u0026rsquo;t need as many chromosomes Prediction 3: There has been a fusion event Compelling evidence: conservation of gene structure/order, common ancestry Chromosome 2 of Human and Chimp shares a common structure Predictions based on evolution If life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, then we should see evidence in the fossil record First detectable traces of life on earth should be simple forms -\u0026gt; more complex forms later Fossils: occur when organismal features are preserved long after death Note: fossil records is incomplete - Soft-bodies preserved less than hard - Rare species even rarer - Lack of sedimentation - Highly dependent on conditions - few were fossilized - Formed through permineralization: organism is buried, filled with mineral rich waters, turns tissue to stone, cellularly\nThere are organic materials preserved from \u0026lsquo;recent time\u0026rsquo; which are not fossil records e.g., Baby mammoth - 40,000 y/o\nGeological Dating\nGeological strata are arranged in order: Oldest = Deepest Geological processes may move strata after formation Radiometric dating from isotope half-life provides absolute age Recent (~50,000 years) - Radiocarbon dating (Carbon, $^{14}C$) Older (\u0026gt; millions of years) - Radioactive dating (Uranium - Lead) Quantify how much of these atoms are remaining in the fossil Radiocarbon dating\nNeutrons emitted from the cosmic radiation collides with $^{14}N$ to create $^{14}C$ $^{14}C$ bonds with oxygens to form $CO_2$ and ends up in plants and animals through photosynthesis and plant consumption After organisms die and are buried, $^{14}C$ decays to the stable $^{14}N$ Half the $^{14}C$ turns to $^{14}N$ every 5730 years The level of $^{14}C$ in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of $^{14}C$ in the atmosphere at that time Directly compared with know year-by-year data from tree-ring data (~13,000 years), ocean and lake sediments, corals and stalagmites (now ~55,000 years) Radioactive Dating\nUranium 235/238, Error: 2 million years in 2.5 billion years Measure the ages of rocks The earliest life form\nCyanobacteria: first appeared on earth 3.5 billion years ago Terminologies niche: the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of the species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem\nvirulence: the quality of being poisonous or injurious to life\npopulation: individuals of species at same time and same place, interbreed, producing fertile offspring\ngene pool: all the alleles present in all individuals in a population or in a species e.g. alleles for skin colour, hair type, eye colour, etc\npopulations: all the individuals of a given species that live and reproduce in the same geograhpical area; one of several interbreeding groups of organisms of the same species living in the same geographical area\npaternity: a state of being someone\u0026rsquo;s father\nmetamorphosis: a biological process by which an animal physically developes including birth transformation or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal\u0026rsquo;s body structure through cell growth and differentiation\nretrodiction: an explanataion of past actions or events\nstratum: a layer of a series of layers of rock in the ground\nisotope: an atom with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons\nstalagmite: a type of rock formation that rises from the floor of a cave due to the accumulation of material deposited on the floor from ceiling drippings\npolymorphism: variable nucleotide positions\nlethal: sufficient to cause death\ngenetic drift: a random change in the frequency of an allele due to the statistical effects of finite population size\nallele frequency: commonndess or rarity of each allele in the gene pool assuming individuals are diploid and both gametes contribute to the production of offspring\nherd: a social group of certain animals of the same species\nheterozygote advantage: a form of balancing selection in which the heterozygote\u0026rsquo;s fitness is higher than that of either of the homozygotes resulting in selection that ensures that both alleles remain in the population at intermediate frequencies\n",
