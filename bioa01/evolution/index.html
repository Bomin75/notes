<h2 id="introduction-to-evolution">Introduction to Evolution</h2>
<h3 id="variation-in-populations">Variation in Populations</h3>
<h4 id="why-is-variation-beneficial-for-evolution">Why is Variation Beneficial for Evolution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Variation in populations plays a key role in <strong>natural selection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural seletion</strong> depicts that the variants with characteristics that are best applicable for an environment in terms of <strong>growth and reproduction</strong> will contribute the most to the next generation. e.g.
<ul>
<li>Farmers choosing seeds with high yield and resistency to drought and disease</li>
<li>Breeders developing different breeds of dogs e.g. terriors, huskies (Selection under domestication)</li>
<li>Rise in antibiotic resistance of disease-causing microorganisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-does-variation-occur">How does Variation Occur?</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Environmental Selection</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Occurs due to differences in the environment e.g.
<ul>
<li>Exposure to sunlight</li>
<li>Exposure to female codling moth (its egg develops into a caterpillar and eats its way into the fruit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Genetic Variation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Occurs due to differences in the genetic material e.g.
<ul>
<li>Types of apples with different tastes and color (green Granny Smith, yellow Golden Delicious, scarlet Red Delicious)</li>
<li>Individual apples within a tree (due to unique combinations of genes through fertilizaion process)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stems from genetic <strong>mutations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mutations</strong> arise from:
<ol>
<li>Random errors when passing genetic materials i.e. during DNA replication</li>
<li>Environmental factors e.g. UV radiation, cigarette smoke</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Harmful variations die out overtime</li>
<li>Beneficial veriations thrive</li>
<li>Neither can persist overtime</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolutionary-trees">Evolutionary Trees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evolution can be illustrated using a tree diagram as following. Branches represent different groups or organisms and nodes indicate the most recent common ancestor
<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Evolutionary_Tree_Primates.png" alt="evolutionaryTreePrimates"  />
</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Tree of Life</strong>: the full set of evolutionary relationships along all organisms
<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Tree_Of_Life.png" alt="treeOfLife"  />
</p>
</li>
<li>Most branches on the tree of life consist of microorganisms</li>
<li>Despite that the tree shows the origin of eukarya to be archaea, biologists think it is derived by symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium</li>
<li>The order of life-forms is determined by fossils</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolution-through-experiments">Evolution through Experiments</h3>
<h4 id="can-evolution-be-demonstrated-in-the-laboratory">Can Evolution be Demonstrated in the Laboratory?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Background: In 1988, the biologist Richard Lenski grew <em>E.Coli</em> on a medium with imited amounts of glucose to observe whether they improve on their ability to metabolize glucose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypothesis: Any bacterium wiht a random mutation that increases its ability to take up glucose will reproduct at a faster rate than the other, thereby demonstrating evolution in a bacterial population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment: Cells of <em>E.Coli</em> are frozen at \\(-80\degreeC\\) are kept suspended in animation, surviving without any biological processes. Starting bacteria are labeled <strong>Ancestral</strong> and the bacterial populations taken from the environment with limiting amounts, every 500 generations, of glucose were labeled <strong>Descendant</strong>. Then, compared the rate of growth of these two populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results: The growth rate of the <strong>Descendant</strong> bacterial populations became much steeper than the rate of the <strong>Ancestral</strong> in the given environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion: This experiment demonstrates that <em>E.Coli</em> evolved an improved ability to metabolize glucose overtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow-up: Later studies discovered differences in genetic makeup between <strong>Ancestral</strong> and <strong>Descendant</strong> bacterial populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application: Development of beneficial strains of microorganisms. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing toxins from lakes and rivers</li>
<li>Understand how pathogens develop resistance to drugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="genetic-variation">Genetic Variation</h2>
<p>In spite of a high degree of phenotypic variation, humans rank low in terms of overall genetic variation. Humans differ from each other by 1 DNA base per 1000 (99.9% identical), whereas fruit flies differ by 10 DNA bases per 1000 (99% identical).</p>
<p>Note that both genotype and environment contribute to the phenotype of an individual, which makes it hard for us to compare genetic variation directly. We can achieve this through DNA sequencing.</p>
<h3 id="population-genetics">Population Genetics</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-species">What is a species?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A group of individuals that are capable of sharing alleles</li>
<li>Each individual represents different combinations of alleles drawn from the <a href="#gene-pool" >gene pool</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-population-genetics">What is Population Genetics?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The study of genetic variation in natural <a href="#populations" >populations</a>
</li>
<li>This discipline answers the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Which factors determine the amount of variation in a population and in a species?</li>
<li>Why are humans genetically less variable than fruit flies?</li>
<li>Which factors affect the distribution of particular variations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sources-of-genetic-variation">Sources of Genetic Variation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mutation</strong>: generates new alleles</p>
<p>Mutation by effective range</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Somatic mutation</strong>: occur in the body&rsquo;s tissues in nonreproductive cells
<ul>
<li>Only affects one individual</li>
<li>e.g. skin cancer due to somatic mutation is not inherited</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Germ-line mutation</strong>: occur in the reproductive cells i.g. sperms, eggs
<ul>
<li>Appear in every cell of an offspring</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutation by effects on an organism</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neutral mutation</strong>: despite every human naturally having around 60 new mutations, most of them have little to no effect as a large part of genome consists of noncoding DNA</li>
<li><strong>Deleterious mutation</strong>: most of mutations occuring in protein-coding regions have a harmful effect</li>
<li><strong>Advantageous mutation</strong>: delivers a beneficial effect, rarely occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recombination</strong>: shuffles mutations and generates new permutations, followed by segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic cell division</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="measuring-genetic-variation">Measuring Genetic Variation</h2>
<h2 id="terminologies">Terminologies</h2>
<p><a id="gene-pool"></a><strong>gene pool</strong>: all the alleles present in all individuals in a population or in a species e.g. alleles for skin colour, hair type, eye colour, etc</p>
<p><a id="populations"></a><strong>populations</strong>: all the individuals of a given species that live and reproduce in the same geograhpical area; one of several interbreeding groups of organisms of the same species living in the same geographical area</p>
