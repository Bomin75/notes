Life displays great diversity with 10 million or more species. The unity and the diversity of life are explained by **evolution**.

## Introduction to Evolution

### What is Evolution?

Basic Definition:

- Change through time
- Decent with motification
- Darwin's "Pangenesis": proposal that each part of the body continually emits small particles called gemmules that contribute to the heritable information to the gametes

**Biological** Definition:

- Change in allele or genotype frequencies in populations over time

Note:

- Evolution occurs in **populations**
- Evolution **does not** occur in an individual

### Adaptive Radiation

- Organism diversify rapidly from an acestral species when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental [niche](#niche)
- e.g. Hawaiian Drosophila radiation: alleles and genotypes of Drosophila shift through times as volcanic islands form, are observed through phenotypes, and evolve by natural selection

### How does Evolution affect our lives?

**Penicillin**

- Product of _Penicillium_ mold (Alexander Fleming, 1928)
- Represents an evolved response to bacteria
- First antibiotic drug based on a naturally occuring substance
- Four years of of use -> _Staphylococcus_ strains resistant went up to 14%
- By 1950, resistant became more than 50%

**Penicillin: today**

- Continue to develop new strains of penicillin
- Identify and locate resistance
- Need to minimize dependence on antibiotics
- Resistant bacteria still kills 30,000 to 40,000 Americans each year

**COVID-19**

- Mutations lead to variations, which can exceptionally be problematic
- Properties of variants: [virulence](#virulence), dispersal, symptoms

### Micro vs Macro

**Microevolution**

- Changes within a species
- Caused by natural selection or evolutionary forces
- Depends on heritable variation in genetics of a [population](#population)
- **Traits** can be under strong natural selection e.g. antibiotic resistance

**Macroevolution**

- Changes between species

## Microevolution

### Phenotypic Variation

Heritable variation in appearance and/or function

- **Qualitative variation**:

  - Discrete characteristics
  - **Polymorphism**: distinct variatns of character
  - e.g. two-spot ladybug

- **Quantitative variation**:
  - Continuous and measurable characteristics
  - Controlled by multiple genes
  - e.g. height

Examples of Phenotypic Variation

- European Garden Snails vary in colour as there is no selective pressure acting on it. In a hypothetical situation, the population can converge towards a brown-coloured snails if the predators evolve to detect the bright colours better.
- Bahamian Land Snails are under a strong selective pressure, having only a few, non-distinguishable phenotypic variation.

Factors of the Phenotypic Variation

- Phenotypic variation is due to **genetics (genotype)**, **environment**, or **both**
- Only genetic component of phenotype are heritable

### Phenotypic Variation Experiment

1. Keep Genetics constant (e.g. clone), Vary Environment

- The clour of Hydrangeas vary depending on the pH of soil (acidic: blue, basic: pink)

2. Breeding and Selection

- Important as evolution can only act on heritable variation
- Artificially selected mouse with higher activity level (experimental lines) and compared with control lines (no artificial selection) -> found out that there was underlying genetic variation for activity level
- **Mandelian genetics**

### Genetic Variation

Causes

1. New alleles from mutations
2. Recombination: from crossing over, independent assortment, random fertilization

Types

1. **Germ-line mutations**: occur in the reproductive cells -> inherited
2. **Somatic mutations**: occur in the non-reproductive cells -> does not get inherited

### Population Genetics

The study of patterns in genetic variation in populations

- Individuals within a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur
- Individuals within a population are closely related to each other than members of other populations
- Different populations of the same species may be isolated from each other such that gene flow is rare

**Gene Pool**

- Sum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population
- Characterizes a population's genetic makeup
- Used to identify the genotypes and calculate **genotype frequencies**
- Given that species is diploids and have two alleles of each gene, we can calculate **allele frequencies**

## Evolutionary Agents

### Genotypes and Alleles

- **Genotype frequency**: the % of individuals in a population with a specific genotype -> shows the distribution of allele combinations in a population
- **Allele frequency**: the % of all copies of a certain gene in a population that carry a specific allele -> shows the distribution of genetic variation in a population
- Evolution is measured as changes in **allele frequencies** in populations

### Computing Frequencies

Notations
$$p=\text{frequency of one allele}$$
$$q=\text{frequency of another allele}$$
$$p+q=1 \text{ (normalization)}$$

Genotype Frequencies of the Next Genetation

Assuming that the population is in equilibrium for the C locus, we have
$$(p+q)\times(p+q)=p^2+2pq+q^2$$
where
$$p^2= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^R)$$
$$2pq= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^W)$$
$$q^2= (\text{frequency of }C^WC^W)$$

Example

- Conisder **Snapdragons** that exhibit **incomplete dominance** with distinctive phenotype of heterozygotes
- Let $p=0.7, q=0.3$
- Then, expected genotype frequencies in the next generation are
  $$p^2= 0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49$$
  $$2pq= 2 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.42$$
  $$q^2= 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$$
- Predicted countings are 490, 420, and 90.
- Actual countings are 410, 423, and 167, respectively
- Thus, we can conclude that one of the Hardy-Weinberg principles is violated and the population is evolving with the selective force towards the $C^W$ allele.

### The Hardy-Weinberg Principle

- **Null model**: assume the absence of evolutionary change and compare it to the real population
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: describes a population where the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remains constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mandelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work
- The **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** occurs when the following conditions are met:
  1. **No mutation**
  2. **No gene flow**: population is closed to migration from other populations
  3. **Infinite population**
  4. **No natural selection**: all genotypes survive and reproduce equally
  5. **Random mating**: individuals mate randomly with respect to genotypes

### Microevolutionary Agents

1. **Mutation**: a heritable change in DNA -> introduces new genetic variation into population

- Rare event, significant over long time scales
- **Deleterious** or **lethal** mutations are harmful but may persist if recessive
- **Neutral mutations** are neither harmful or helpful e.g. **slient mutation** that does not alter amino acids
- **Advantageous mutations** benefit an organism e.g. novel host adaptation

2. **Gene flow**: change in allele frequencies as individuals join a population and reproduce -> may introduce genetic variation from another population

- may be the movement of individuals e.g. seeds or gametes e.g. pollen

3. **Genetic drift**: random changes in allele frequencies caused by chance events -> reduces genetic variation (can eliminate in small populations)

- **Population bottelneck**: caused by catastrophic factors: diseases, starvation, drought -> reduce genetic variation
- **Founders effect**: migrating population may not have the entire genetic variation of the parent population

4. **Natural selection**: differential survivorship or reproduction of individuals with different genotypes -> one allele may increase in frequency

- **Relative fitness** is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contribution of others
- Natural selection can be measured by **fitness**
- **Directional selection**: favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum
- **Stabilizing selection**: favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes
- **Disruptive selection**: favours individuals with extreme phenotypes

5. **Nonrandom mating**: choice of mates based on their phenotypes and genotypes -> does not directly affect allele frequencies but prevent genetic equilibrium

## Variation

### Selection on variation

Example

- Goldenrod gall fly, _Tephritidae_
- Chemically alter the plant stems to produce a larva inside a gall
- Selection factors:
  - A parasitic wasp, _Eurytoma gigantea_, use hormone to find the gall and inject their eggs -> hatches, eats the larvae, steals the protection
    ![LarvaeParasitizedVsGallSize](./Fly_Larvae_Parasitized_vs_Gall_Size.png)
  - Note that larger sized galls are not attacked effectively as a parasitic wasp is small -> selection towards large gall
  - A downy woodpecker, _Picoides pubescens_, is also a predator of the golden gall larvae
    ![LarvaeEatenVsGallSize](./Fly_Larvae_Eaten_vs_Gall_Size.png)
  - Note that large galls are attacked more as the woodpeckers cannot perch on the small galls -> selection towards small gall
- When these two predators are present, stabilizing selection occurs and the gall size converges towards the mean

### Sexual selection

- Competition for mates
- A type of a natural selection

Sexual Cannibalism

- Adaptive male strategy
- Happens if benefits of being eaten > male's expected future reproductive value
- Benefits of being eaten
  - Increased [paternity](#paternity)
  - Decreased likelihood of female remating

Gray Tree Frogs

- Females prefer males with long calls
- Tadpole survival: long call > short call
- Tadpole growth: long call > short call
- Time to [metamorphosis](#metamorphosis): long call < short call

Why is there still variation when selection is so strong?

- Not all females have strong preferences
- Females cannot always mate the "best" male
- Note that relative fitness is not absolute

### Balancing selection

- Various forms of selection that lead to the active maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations
- Alleles are said to be "balanced" when a stable equilibrium state is reached
- If allele frequencies are perturbed from this equilibrium, selection will return them back to that state

Balanced polymorphisms

1. Heterozygote Advantage

a state where heterozygotes are preferred over homozygotes

- Sickle cell anemia and malaria
- Sickled cells clog the arteries but are beneficial at fighting against malaria
- Thus, HbA/Hba heterozygote that produces both normal and sickled forms of hemoglobin is preferred

2. Negative Frequency-dependent Selection

high fitness when rare

- _Perissodus_ are either right-mouthed or left-mouthed
- If right-jawed fish is common, _Perissodus_ evolves to be left-mouthed
- So the fish evolves to be left-jawed, causing _Perissodus_ to evolve right-mouthed

### Adaptation

- **Adaptive traits**: products of selection that increase relative fitness
- **Adaptation**:
  - Accumulation of adaptive traits over time
  - Adaptation hypotheses must be tested
  - Current structures came from existing structures
  - Some traits arise by chance and not selection

### Nautral selection

- Note that natural selection does not necessarily lead to an absolute optimal solution
- Simply prefers a competitive optimum

Why there is no perfect oraganism?

- Selection can only act on existing variation
- Adaptations are often compromises
  - Environments change over time and have competing selection pressures
- Adaptations lag environmental change
  - The traits observed in a population today are the result of natural selection acting in the past
- Chance, natural selection, the environment all interact

## Darwin (Macroevolution)

### Controversy of evolution

- Before Darwin, when **natural theology** was prevalent, it was believed that all organisms are perfectly designed to fit in the environment through God's divine guidance

### Some appreciation that nature changes

- Comparative **morphology** revealed structural similarities in dissimilar anatomies
  ![Similarity_in_Dissimiliar_Anatomies](./Similarity_in_Dissimilar_Anatomies.png)
- Currently useless structures, **vestigial structures** were found

### Fossils

Startification

- Horizontal layering of sedimentary rocks
- Different **fossils** in different layers
- Fossils suggested extinction

Paleobiology

- Study of ancient organisms

Catastrophism

- Theory of fossil formation by catastrophe

### Jean-Baptiste Lamarck

Made important contributions to evolution thinking

- Species change over time and pass on changes
- Organisms respond to the environment
- Hypothesized an incorrect mechanism
  - Principle of use and disuse and subsequent inheritance
  - It's not the organism's will, but the environment that takes charge in selection

### Darwin

- Went to medical school but did not like it
- Became friends with a professor **Robert Grant**, who changed from medical school to natural history
- Became friends with a Guyanese taxidermist **John Edmunstone** and learned taxidermy
- Father sent Darwin to Christ's College to become a minister
- Became friends with a professor **John Henslow**, talking about nature -> Suggested Darwin the idea of exploration
- Met **Adam Sedgwick** and became interested in the history of the earth
- Met a captain **Robert Fitzroy** and got on the boat (his father paid)
- **Charles Lyell** encouraged Darwin to make his first publication
- Darwin frustrated by the prevalent idea in the society regarding racism and promoting inequality
- Darwin was discouraged to share his "dangerous idea"
- Darwin's daughter Annie died -> Darwin decided to get his idea out in the world
- Letter from **Alfred Russel Wallace** with the similar idea
- Alfred and Darwin co-authored a paper
- "The Origin of Species" (1859)
  - **Descent with Modification**: fossils of Patagonia as evidence, "principle of succession"
  - **Divergence in Isolation from a Common Ancestor**: each island had similar physical conditions but distinct species of mockingbirds, tortoises, etc
- Darwin believed in **monogenism**, opposing **polygenism** (racial essentialism), but also was a s**sexist**

## Evidence

### Alfred Russel Wallace

- Worked with Darwin
- Activism for environmental issues
- Fire on ship, all specimens lost
- Found the striking pattern in the distribution of animals around the Malay archipelago
- Proposed an imaginary line dividing the region in two parts
- Came to conclusion that the fittest individuals survived and reproduced, passing their advantageous characteristics on to their offspring

### Evolution is a theory

In science:

- Theory is not a guess or a hunch
- Theory is well-established, well-supported, well-documented explanations for our observations

Laws describe, Theories explain

### Macroevolution

Evolution

- **Things evolve**: populations change over time
- **Evolution usually happens gradually**: populations change over hundreds to thousands of years
- **Speciation occurs**: one species splits into two or more species
- **All species share common ancestry**: splitting of lineages from one ancestral form
- **Much of evolutionary change caused by natural selection**: the sole process producing adaptation, the 'appearance' of design

Predictions based on evolution

- If life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, we should see evidence in the fossil record
- If evolution occured within lineages, and those linages sometimes split then we should see change in species or morphology through the fossil record
- If organisms share a common ancestry, then we should see transitional forms
- We should see evidence of [retrodictions](#retrodiction) and vestigial characters
- We should be able to see evidence of **natural selection**
  ![finches](./Finches.png)

### Peter & Rosemary Grant

- Once professors at McGill, then Princeton
- Long-term fieldwork on the Galapagos Islands
- Natural selection in action

### Peter Boag

- Intended to do a study on the heritability of beak size by swapping eggs to control for parental care

### Finches

Under normal circumstance

- Most finches eat a preferred 24 types of seeds
- G. _fortis_, a medium ground finch and G. _magnirostris_, a large ground finch have the identical preference
- Birds spent ~50% time foraging on their seven favourite seeds
- High abundance of seeds ($10g/m^2$) -> Less selection via competition

After a massive drought

- Boag thought his thesis was ruined
- Food availability decreased by 84%
- Variety decreased by $\frac{1}{2}$
- Remaining seeds were big and tough
- Birds spent ~0.03% time foraging on favourites
- Soon after only a few types of seeds left
- Little to no mating opportunities
- Seed abundance decreased to $<3g/m^2$
- Large _fortis_ ate large seeds
- Medium _fortis_ ate medium seeds
- Small _fortis_ ate small seeds
- Birds were even forced to feed on the dreaded _Tribulus_
  - Extremely sharp spines
  - Mericarps are usually ignored by the finches
  - Only _fortis_ and _magnirostris_ can break open it's hard spines

Different strategies for eating _Tribulus_

- _Magnirostris_
  - Crushes seeds with its beek
  - Requires $200N$ of force
  - Can often eat all the seeds in one mericarp
  - Gets 2.5x more energy per minute than medium ground finches but larger -> needs more energy
- _Fortis_
  - Too small to crush the seeds
  - Braces it against a rock to split it open
  - Requires $54N$ of force
  - Cost: feawer seeds obtained per mericarp
  - Steal from _magnirostris_

Small G. _Fortis_ could not open _Tribulus_

- Forced to feed on _Chamaesyce_
  - Herb with small soft seeds
  - Exudes a sticky, milky latex
- Latex gets stick to their heads
- Feathers on their heads fall off
- Bald birds die in the hot sun

Beak depth variation in G. _fortis_
![Beak_Depth_Variation](./Beak_Depth_Variation.png)

Evolutionary response of G. _fortis_ after the drought

- Decline in population size
- Decrease in seed abundance
- Increase in seed hardness

-> increase in weight, wing length, tarsus length, bill length, bill depth, and bill width

Note: Survival is not random. Larger birds are more likely to survive than the smaller birds

Summary

- Role of adaptations (morphology and behaviour) may be evident only during times of stress and competition
- Without competition:
  - Variation fills in
  - Less selection on the adaptations
- With competition:
  - adaptations become important
  - increase in selection
  - decrease in variation

Genetics of beak morphology

- Gene Bmp4 is responsible for beak depth
- Candidate gene from chicken
- Finches with deeper beaks have strong expression of Bmp4

### Humans and Chimpanzees

- Chimpanzees are humans' most closely related species
- Humans have 23 chromosomes while Chimpanzees have 24

What happened to that chromosome?

- Prediction 1: It was lost, we didn't need those genes (through natural selection)
- Prediction 2: A Creator distributed the genes differently, didn't need as many chromosomes
- Prediction 3: There has been a **fusion event**
  - Compelling evidence: conservation of gene structure/order, common ancestry
  - Chromosome 2 of Human and Chimp shares a common structure

### Predictions based on evolution

1. If life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, then we should see evidence in the fossil record

- First detectable traces of life on earth should be simple forms -> more complex forms later
- Fossils: occur when organismal features are preserved long after death

Note: fossil records is incomplete - Soft-bodies preserved less than hard - Rare species even rarer - Lack of sedimentation - Highly dependent on conditions - few were fossilized - Formed through **permineralization**: organism is buried, filled with mineral rich waters, turns tissue to stone, cellularly

There are organic materials preserved from 'recent time' which are not fossil records e.g., Baby mammoth - 40,000 y/o

Geological Dating

- Geological [strata](#stratum) are arranged in order:
  - Oldest = Deepest
  - Geological processes may move strata after formation
- **Radiometric dating** from [isotope](#isotope) half-life provides absolute age
  - Recent (~50,000 years) - Radiocarbon dating (Carbon, $^{14}C$)
  - Older (> millions of years) - Radioactive dating (Uranium - Lead)
  - Quantify how much of these atoms are remaining in the fossil

1. Radiocarbon dating


    - Neutrons emitted from the cosmic radiation collides with $^{14}N$ to create $^{14}C$
    - $^{14}C$ bonds with oxygens to form $CO_2$ and ends up in plants and animals through photosynthesis and plant consumption
    - After organisms die and are buried, $^{14}C$ decays to the stable $^{14}N$
    - Half the $^{14}C$ turns to $^{14}N$ every 5730 years
    - The level of $^{14}C$ in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of $^{14}C$ in the atmosphere at that time
    - Directly compared with know year-by-year data from tree-ring data (~13,000 years), ocean and lake sediments, corals and [stalagmites](#stalagmite) (now ~55,000 years)

2. Radioactive Dating


    - Uranium 235/238, Error: 2 million years in 2.5 billion years
    - Measure the ages of rocks

The earliest life form

- **Cyanobacteria**: first appeared on earth 3.5 billion years ago
