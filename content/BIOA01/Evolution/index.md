Life displays great diversity with 10 million or more species. The unity and the diversity of life are explained by **evolution**.

## Introduction to Evolution

### What is Evolution?

Basic Definition:

- Change through time
- Decent with motification
- Darwin's "Pangenesis": proposal that each part of the body continually emits small particles called gemmules that contribute to the heritable information to the gametes

**Biological** Definition:

- Change in allele or genotype frequencies in populations over time

Note:

- Evolution occurs in **populations**
- Evolution **does not** occur in an individual

### Adaptive Radiation

- Organism diversify rapidly from an acestral species when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental [niche](#niche)
- e.g. Hawaiian Drosophila radiation: alleles and genotypes of Drosophila shift through times as volcanic islands form, are observed through phenotypes, and evolve by natural selection

### How does Evolution affect our lives?

**Penicillin**

- Product of _Penicillium_ mold (Alexander Fleming, 1928)
- Represents an evolved response to bacteria
- First antibiotic drug based on a naturally occuring substance
- Four years of of use -> _Staphylococcus_ strains resistant went up to 14%
- By 1950, resistant became more than 50%

**Penicillin: today**

- Continue to develop new strains of penicillin
- Identify and locate resistance
- Need to minimize dependence on antibiotics
- Resistant bacteria still kills 30,000 to 40,000 Americans each year

**COVID-19**

- Mutations lead to variations, which can exceptionally be problematic
- Properties of variants: [virulence](#virulence), dispersal, symptoms

### Micro vs Macro

**Microevolution**

- Changes within a species
- Caused by natural selection or evolutionary forces
- Depends on heritable variation in genetics of a [population](#population)
- **Traits** can be under strong natural selection e.g. antibiotic resistance

**Macroevolution**

- Changes between species

## Microevolution

### Phenotypic Variation

Heritable variation in appearance and/or function

- **Qualitative variation**:

  - Discrete characteristics
  - **Polymorphism**: distinct variatns of character
  - e.g. two-spot ladybug

- **Quantitative variation**:
  - Continuous and measurable characteristics
  - Controlled by multiple genes
  - e.g. height

Examples of Phenotypic Variation

- European Garden Snails vary in colour as there is no selective pressure acting on it. In a hypothetical situation, the population can converge towards a brown-coloured snails if the predators evolve to detect the bright colours better.
- Bahamian Land Snails are under a strong selective pressure, having only a few, non-distinguishable phenotypic variation.

Factors of the Phenotypic Variation

- Phenotypic variation is due to **genetics (genotype)**, **environment**, or **both**
- Only genetic component of phenotype are heritable

### Phenotypic Variation Experiment

1. Keep Genetics constant (e.g. clone), Vary Environment

- The clour of Hydrangeas vary depending on the pH of soil (acidic: blue, basic: pink)

2. Breeding and Selection

- Important as evolution can only act on heritable variation
- Artificially selected mouse with higher activity level (experimental lines) and compared with control lines (no artificial selection) -> found out that there was underlying genetic variation for activity level
- **Mandelian genetics**

### Genetic Variation

Causes

1. New alleles from mutations
2. Recombination: from crossing over, independent assortment, random fertilization

Types

1. **Germ-line mutations**: occur in the reproductive cells -> inherited
2. **Somatic mutations**: occur in the non-reproductive cells -> does not get inherited

### Population Genetics

The study of patterns in genetic variation in populations

- Individuals within a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur
- Individuals within a population are closely related to each other than members of other populations
- Different populations of the same species may be isolated from each other such that gene flow is rare

**Gene Pool**

- Sum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population
- Characterizes a population's genetic makeup
- Used to identify the genotypes and calculate **genotype frequencies**
- Given that species is diploids and have two alleles of each gene, we can calculate **allele frequencies**

## Evolutionary Agents

### Genotypes and Alleles

- **Genotype frequency**: the % of individuals in a population with a specific genotype -> shows the distribution of allele combinations in a population
- **Allele frequency**: the % of all copies of a certain gene in a population that carry a specific allele -> shows the distribution of genetic variation in a population
- Evolution is measured as changes in **allele frequencies** in populations

### Computing Frequencies

Notations
$$p=\text{frequency of one allele}$$
$$q=\text{frequency of another allele}$$
$$p+q=1 \text{ (normalization)}$$

Genotype Frequencies of the Next Genetation

Assuming that the population is in equilibrium for the C locus, we have
$$(p+q)\times(p+q)=p^2+2pq+q^2$$
where
$$p^2= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^R)$$
$$2pq= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^W)$$
$$q^2= (\text{frequency of }C^WC^W)$$

Example

- Conisder **Snapdragons** that exhibit **incomplete dominance** with distinctive phenotype of heterozygotes
- Let $p=0.7, q=0.3$
- Then, expected genotype frequencies in the next generation are
  $$p^2= 0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49$$
  $$2pq= 2 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.42$$
  $$q^2= 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$$
- Predicted countings are 490, 420, and 90.
- Actual countings are 410, 423, and 167, respectively
- Thus, we can conclude that one of the Hardy-Weinberg principles is violated and the population is evolving with the selective force towards the $C^W$ allele.

### The Hardy-Weinberg Principle

- **Null model**: assume the absence of evolutionary change and compare it to the real population
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: describes a population where the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remains constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mandelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work
- The **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** occurs when the following conditions are met:
  1. **No mutation**
  2. **No gene flow**: population is closed to migration from other populations
  3. **Infinite population**
  4. **No natural selection**: all genotypes survive and reproduce equally
  5. **Random mating**: individuals mate randomly with respect to genotypes

### Microevolutionary Agents

1. **Mutation**: a heritable change in DNA -> introduces new genetic variation into population

- Rare event, significant over long time scales
- **Deleterious** or **lethal** mutations are harmful but may persist if recessive
- **Neutral mutations** are neither harmful or helpful e.g. **slient mutation** that does not alter amino acids
- **Advantageous mutations** benefit an organism e.g. novel host adaptation

2. **Gene flow**: change in allele frequencies as individuals join a population and reproduce -> may introduce genetic variation from another population

- may be the movement of individuals e.g. seeds or gametes e.g. pollen

3. **Genetic drift**: random changes in allele frequencies caused by chance events -> reduces genetic variation (can eliminate in small populations)

- **Population bottelneck**: caused by catastrophic factors: diseases, starvation, drought -> reduce genetic variation
- **Founders effect**: migrating population may not have the entire genetic variation of the parent population

4. **Natural selection**: differential survivorship or reproduction of individuals with different genotypes -> one allele may increase in frequency

- **Relative fitness** is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contribution of others
- Natural selection can be measured by **fitness**
- **Directional selection**: favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum
- **Stabilizing selection**: favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes
- **Disruptive selection**: favours individuals with extreme phenotypes

5. **Nonrandom mating**: choice of mates based on their phenotypes and genotypes -> does not directly affect allele frequencies but prevent genetic equilibrium

## Variation

### Selection on variation

Example

- Goldenrod gall fly, _Tephritidae_
- Chemically alter the plant stems to produce a larva inside a gall
- Selection factors:
  - A parasitic wasp, _Eurytoma gigantea_, use hormone to find the gall and inject their eggs -> hatches, eats the larvae, steals the protection
    ![LarvaeParasitizedVsGallSize](./Fly_Larvae_Parasitized_vs_Gall_Size.png)
  - Note that larger sized galls are not attacked effectively as a parasitic wasp is small -> selection towards large gall
  - A downy woodpecker, _Picoides pubescens_, is also a predator of the golden gall larvae
    ![LarvaeEatenVsGallSize](./Fly_Larvae_Eaten_vs_Gall_Size.png)
  - Note that large galls are attacked more as the woodpeckers cannot perch on the small galls -> selection towards small gall
- When these two predators are present, stabilizing selection occurs and the gall size converges towards the mean

### Sexual selection

- Competition for mates
- A type of a natural selection

Sexual Cannibalism

- Adaptive male strategy
- Happens if benefits of being eaten > male's expected future reproductive value
- Benefits of being eaten
  - Increased [paternity](#paternity)
  - Decreased likelihood of female remating

Gray Tree Frogs

- Females prefer males with long calls
- Tadpole survival: long call > short call
- Tadpole growth: long call > short call
- Time to [metamorphosis](#metamorphosis): long call < short call

Why is there still variation when selection is so strong?

- Not all females have strong preferences
- Females cannot always mate the "best" male
- Note that relative fitness is not absolute

### Balancing selection

- Various forms of selection that lead to the active maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations
- Alleles are said to be "balanced" when a stable equilibrium state is reached
- If allele frequencies are perturbed from this equilibrium, selection will return them back to that state

Balanced polymorphisms

1. Heterozygote Advantage

a state where heterozygotes are preferred over homozygotes

- Sickle cell anemia and malaria
- Sickled cells clog the arteries but are beneficial at fighting against malaria
- Thus, HbA/Hba heterozygote that produces both normal and sickled forms of hemoglobin is preferred

2. Negative Frequency-dependent Selection

high fitness when rare

- _Perissodus_ are either right-mouthed or left-mouthed
- If right-jawed fish is common, _Perissodus_ evolves to be left-mouthed
- So the fish evolves to be left-jawed, causing _Perissodus_ to evolve right-mouthed

### Adaptation

- **Adaptive traits**: products of selection that increase relative fitness
- **Adaptation**:
  - Accumulation of adaptive traits over time
  - Adaptation hypotheses must be tested
  - Current structures came from existing structures
  - Some traits arise by chance and not selection

### Nautral selection

- Note that natural selection does not necessarily lead to an absolute optimal solution
- Simply prefers a competitive optimum

Why there is no perfect oraganism?

- Selection can only act on existing variation
- Adaptations are often compromises
  - Environments change over time and have competing selection pressures
- Adaptations lag environmental change
  - The traits observed in a population today are the result of natural selection acting in the past
- Chance, natural selection, the environment all interact

## Darwin (Macroevolution)

### Controversy of evolution

- Before Darwin, when **natural theology** was prevalent, it was believed that all organisms are perfectly designed to fit in the environment through God's divine guidance

### Some appreciation that nature changes

- Comparative **morphology** revealed structural similarities in dissimilar anatomies
  ![Similarity_in_Dissimiliar_Anatomies](./Similarity_in_Dissimilar_Anatomies.png)
- Currently useless structures, **vestigial structures** were found

### Fossils

Startification

- Horizontal layering of sedimentary rocks
- Different **fossils** in different layers
- Fossils suggested extinction

Paleobiology

- Study of ancient organisms

Catastrophism

- Theory of fossil formation by catastrophe

### Jean-Baptiste Lamarck

Made important contributions to evolution thinking

- Species change over time and pass on changes
- Organisms respond to the environment
- Hypothesized an incorrect mechanism
  - Principle of use and disuse and subsequent inheritance
  - It's not the organism's will, but the environment that takes charge in selection

### Darwin

- Went to medical school but did not like it
- Became friends with a professor **Robert Grant**, who changed from medical school to natural history
- Became friends with a Guyanese taxidermist **John Edmunstone** and learned taxidermy
- Father sent Darwin to Christ's College to become a minister
- Became friends with a professor **John Henslow**, talking about nature -> Suggested Darwin the idea of exploration
- Met **Adam Sedgwick** and became interested in the history of the earth
- Met a captain **Robert Fitzroy** and got on the boat (his father paid)
- **Charles Lyell** encouraged Darwin to make his first publication
- Darwin frustrated by the prevalent idea in the society regarding racism and promoting inequality
- Darwin was discouraged to share his "dangerous idea"
- Darwin's daughter Annie died -> Darwin decided to get his idea out in the world
- Letter from **Alfred Russel Wallace** with the similar idea
- Alfred and Darwin co-authored a paper
- "The Origin of Species" (1859)
  - **Descent with Modification**: fossils of Patagonia as evidence, "principle of succession"
  - **Divergence in Isolation from a Common Ancestor**: each island had similar physical conditions but distinct species of mockingbirds, tortoises, etc
- Darwin believed in **monogenism**, opposing **polygenism** (racial essentialism), but also was a s**sexist**

## Evidence

### Alfred Russel Wallace

- Worked with Darwin
- Activism for environmental issues
- Fire on ship, all specimens lost
- Found the striking pattern in the distribution of animals around the Malay archipelago
- Proposed an imaginary line dividing the region in two parts
- Came to conclusion that the fittest individuals survived and reproduced, passing their advantageous characteristics on to their offspring

### Evolution is a theory

In science:

- Theory is not a guess or a hunch
- Theory is well-established, well-supported, well-documented explanations for our observations

Laws describe, Theories explain

### Macroevolution

Evolution

- **Things evolve**: populations change over time
- **Evolution usually happens gradually**: populations change over hundreds to thousands of years
- **Speciation occurs**: one species splits into two or more species
- **All species share common ancestry**: splitting of lineages from one ancestral form
- **Much of evolutionary change caused by natural selection**: the sole process producing adaptation, the 'appearance' of design

Predictions based on evolution

- If life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, we should see evidence in the fossil record
- If evolution occured within lineages, and those linages sometimes split then we should see change in species or morphology through the fossil record
- If organisms share a common ancestry, then we should see transitional forms
- We should see evidence of [retrodictions](#retrodiction) and vestigial characters
- We should be able to see evidence of **natural selection**
  ![finches](./Finches.png)

### Peter & Rosemary Grant

- Once professors at McGill, then Princeton
- Long-term fieldwork on the Galapagos Islands
- Natural selection in action

### Peter Boag

- Intended to do a study on the heritability of beak size by swapping eggs to control for parental care

### Finches

Under normal circumstance

- Most finches eat a preferred 24 types of seeds
- G. _fortis_, a medium ground finch and G. _magnirostris_, a large ground finch have the identical preference
- Birds spent ~50% time foraging on their seven favourite seeds
- High abundance of seeds ($10g/m^2$) -> Less selection via competition

After a massive drought

- Boag thought his thesis was ruined
- Food availability decreased by 84%
- Variety decreased by $\frac{1}{2}$
- Remaining seeds were big and tough
- Birds spent ~0.03% time foraging on favourites
- Soon after only a few types of seeds left
- Little to no mating opportunities
- Seed abundance decreased to $<3g/m^2$
- Large _fortis_ ate large seeds
- Medium _fortis_ ate medium seeds
- Small _fortis_ ate small seeds
- Birds were even forced to feed on the dreaded _Tribulus_
  - Extremely sharp spines
  - Mericarps are usually ignored by the finches
  - Only _fortis_ and _magnirostris_ can break open it's hard spines

Different strategies for eating _Tribulus_

- _Magnirostris_
  - Crushes seeds with its beek
  - Requires $200N$ of force
  - Can often eat all the seeds in one mericarp
  - Gets 2.5x more energy per minute than medium ground finches but larger -> needs more energy
- _Fortis_
  - Too small to crush the seeds
  - Braces it against a rock to split it open
  - Requires $54N$ of force
  - Cost: feawer seeds obtained per mericarp
  - Steal from _magnirostris_

Small G. _Fortis_ could not open _Tribulus_

- Forced to feed on _Chamaesyce_
  - Herb with small soft seeds
  - Exudes a sticky, milky latex
- Latex gets stick to their heads
- Feathers on their heads fall off
- Bald birds die in the hot sun

Beak depth variation in G. _fortis_
![Beak_Depth_Variation](./Beak_Depth_Variation.png)

Evolutionary response of G. _fortis_ after the drought

- Decline in population size
- Decrease in seed abundance
- Increase in seed hardness

-> increase in weight, wing length, tarsus length, bill length, bill depth, and bill width

Note: Survival is not random. Larger birds are more likely to survive than the smaller birds

Summary

- Role of adaptations (morphology and behaviour) may be evident only during times of stress and competition
- Without competition:
  - Variation fills in
  - Less selection on the adaptations
- With competition:
  - adaptations become important
  - increase in selection
  - decrease in variation

Genetics of beak morphology

- Gene Bmp4 is responsible for beak depth
- Candidate gene from chicken
- Finches with deeper beaks have strong expression of Bmp4

### Humans and Chimpanzees

- Chimpanzees are humans' most closely related species
- Humans have 23 chromosomes while Chimpanzees have 24

What happened to that chromosome?

- Prediction 1: It was lost, we didn't need those genes (through natural selection)
- Prediction 2: A Creator distributed the genes differently, didn't need as many chromosomes
- Prediction 3: There has been a **fusion event**
  - Compelling evidence: conservation of gene structure/order, common ancestry
  - Chromosome 2 of Human and Chimp shares a common structure

### Predictions based on evolution

#### If life originated on Earth in the distant past and then evolved, then we should see evidence in the fossil record

- First detectable traces of life on earth should be simple forms -> more complex forms later
- Fossils: occur when organismal features are preserved long after death

Note: fossil records is incomplete

- Soft-bodies preserved less than hard
- Rare species even rarer
- Lack of sedimentation
- Highly dependent on conditions - few were fossilized
- Formed through **permineralization**: organism is buried, filled with mineral rich waters, turns tissue to stone, cellularly

There are organic materials preserved from 'recent time' which are not fossil records e.g., Baby mammoth - 40,000 y/o

Geological Dating

- Geological [strata](#stratum) are arranged in order:
  - Oldest = Deepest
  - Geological processes may move strata after formation
- **Radiometric dating** from [isotope](#isotope) half-life provides absolute age
  - Recent (~50,000 years) - Radiocarbon dating (Carbon, $^{14}C$)
  - Older (> millions of years) - Radioactive dating (Uranium - Lead)
  - Quantify how much of these atoms are remaining in the fossil

1. Radiocarbon dating

- Neutrons emitted from the cosmic radiation collides with $^{14}N$ to create $^{14}C$
- $^{14}C$ bonds with oxygens to form $CO_2$ and ends up in plants and animals through photosynthesis and plant consumption
- After organisms die and are buried, $^{14}C$ decays to the stable $^{14}N$
- Half the $^{14}C$ turns to $^{14}N$ every 5730 years
- The level of $^{14}C$ in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of $^{14}C$ in the atmosphere at that time
- Directly compared with know year-by-year data from tree-ring data (~13,000 years), ocean and lake sediments, corals and [stalagmites](#stalagmite) (now ~55,000 years)

2. Radioactive Dating

- Uranium 235/238, Error: 2 million years in 2.5 billion years
- Measure the ages of rocks

The earliest life form

- **Cyanobacteria**: first appeared on earth 3.5 billion years ago

#### If evolution occured within lineages, and those lineages sometimes split, then we should see change in species or morphology through the fossil record

- We should sometimes see one lineage dividing into two or more in the fossil record

Example

- Plaktonic diatom, _Rhizosolenia_, samples from deep sea bore holes
  ![Planktonic_Diatom_Divergence](./Planktonic_Diatom_Divergence.png)
- Marsh's reconstruction of horse evolution
  ![Horse_Evolution](./Horse_Evolution.png)
  Note the non-linear change
  ![Horse_NonLinear](./Horse_Non_Linear.png)

Note: Conservation of structure in fossil records (homology)

#### If creatures share a common ancestry, then we should see transitional forms

- Transitional forms show the **intermediate** states between an ancestral **form** and that of its descendants

Example

- Archeopteryx has boned tails -> transitional form of modern birds
- Tiktaalik has eyes above, can sort of walk -> transitional form between fish and amphibian
  ![Tiktaalik](./Tiktaalik.png)

#### We should see evidence of retrodictions and vestigial characters

**retroduction**: makes sense only in light of evolution, but is not necessarily predicted by evolution

Examples

- Retrodictions in biogeography

  - Lack of [endemic](#endemic) mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish on oceanic islands e.g., Lord Howe, Galapagos
  - These islands rise _de novo_ from sea, devoid of life
  - Mammals on continental islands (Madagascar)
  - Plenty of endemic plants, birds, and insects
  - Life is similar to nearest mainland

- Whales
  - **Atavism**: legs in humpback whale, have appropriate bones

**Vestigial characters**

- Forelimb and Hindlimb spotted in dolphin embryo
- Human fetal yolk sac - empty: we have 3 genes for making yolk proteins, but they are nonfunctional e.g., silenced

  ![Human_Yolk_Sac](./Human_Yolk_Sac.png)

- Humans have genes for making vitamin C but does not work

## Classification

### Cladogram of Vertebrates

![Cladogram_of_Vertebrates](./Cladogram_of_Vertebrates.png)
[amniotic](#amniotic-egg) [egg](#amniotic-egg)

[two](#two-post-orbital-fenestrae) [post-orbital](#two-post-orbital-fenestrae) [fenestrae](#two-post-orbital-fenestrae)

### Hierarchical Classification

- **Common names**: convey meaning in casual usage (monkey, finch, lilac)
  - may cause confusion - some do not accurately reflect the type of organism e.g., Jellyfish
- **Scientific names**: Latin, avoid ambiguity
  - Instituted in $18^{th}$ century by Carolus Linneaus

Example

- Linneaus also grouped them into a hierarchy of increasingly inclusive categories
- _Panthera_ genus:
  - _Panthera pardus_ - Leopard
  - _Panthera leo_ - African lion
  - _Panthera tigris_ - Tiger
  - _Panthera onca_ - Jaguar

Hierarchy
![Hierarchy](./Hierarchy.png)

Ancestral Lineage
![Ancestral_Lineage](./Ancestral_Lineage.png)

Note: a species must have only one species that is most closely related to -> polytomy needs to be resolved

### Phylogenetic trees

- Evolutionary history of a group of organisms can be represented in a grouping diagram called a **phylogenetic tree**
- **Phylogenetic tree**: a simple 2D, bi-furcating diagram that captures the evolution and diversification of a group of organisms through time
- Difference from cladogram: a phylogenetic tree is time calibrated
  - Poisition of the nodes is rooted in time
  - Length of the branches indicate how long that lineage has been around for
- **Systematics**: the science of organizing the history or organismal evolution; use phylogenies
- Trees can change topology through rotation without changing evolutionary relationships

### Determining characters for classification

Characters must be _independent_ for use in classification

1. Independent traits cannot have environmental phenotypic variation

- **Phenotypic plasticity**: a change in the phenotype associated with a given genotype in response to different environmental conditions
- Must be independent from phenotypic plasticity

2. Independent traits must be _independent_

- **Pleiotropy**: expression of multiple unrelated traits by a single gene
- Avoid pleiotropy when selecting traits for phylogeny
- e.g., frizzled feather trait in chickens involve bunch of other traits:
  - higher body temp
  - mature later
  - higher food consumption
  - lay fewer eggs

## Phylogeny

### Tracing phylogenetic patterns

- Constructed using hundreds or thousands of traits
- **Phylogenies are hypothesis** that can change as we obtain new data or apply new methods of constructing the phylogeny
- Considered the true evolutionary relationships when multiple lines of evidence and multiple methods of analysis converge on the same tree
- Computer programs support analysis of traits and tree constructions (e.g., MEGA, Mr. Bayes, PAUP)

### Beauty of Phylogenies

- **Combined with information on the fossil record**, phylogenies can give us a glimpse of the temporal patterns of diversification (e.g., a time of evolution)
- **Combined with biogeographic data**, we can infer _dispersal events_ and [_vicariance_](#vicariance) e.g., Raffelsia
  ![Vicariance](./Vicariance.png)
- **Combined with behaviour, ecology, or morphology data**, phylogenies help us understand the origin and loss of traits and predict traits of unstudied species

### Applications of Phylogenies

- Enhancement in understanding of evolution
- Control of agriculture pests and diseases
- Identification of endangered species and managing wildlife
- Selection of plants and animals for research
- Data needed to test **homologous** vs. **analogous** relationships

### Homologous vs Analogous

**Homologous** traits: similar origin

- Result from common ancestry
- A product of **divergent** evolution
- Fundamental to systematics
- Similar structure and embryonic formation

**Analogous** traits: similar function

- Do not result from common ancestry
- **Homoplasy** (hom-: similar, -plasia: formation):
  - Outcomes of [**convergent**](#convergent-evolution) [evolution](#convergent-evolution)
  - Convergent evolution can be a result of adaptive radiations that occur in [**Allopatry**](#allopatry) e.g., Mammals / [Marsupisals](#marsupisal)
    ![Mammals_vs_Marsupisals](./Mammals_vs_Marsupisals.png)
  - Can be as simple as single gene changes, or complex and involve reorganization of multiple systems to converge on a solution
  - e.g., human eyes vs. octopus eyes
  - e.g., halteres in crane flies and twisted wing parasites (used for **gyroscopy**: to detect the deviation of an object from its desired orientation)
  - Not used in systematics
- Different from the conservation of structure (homology)

### Ancestral vs Derived

Inherited traits may be **ancestral** or **derived** depending on the point of reference in phylogeny

- **Ancestral**: a trait that was present in the ancestor of a group/clade
- **Derived**: a trait that differs from close ancestral trait

  - Deteremined from fossils and embryos/larval stage
  - Derived characters appear later in development
  - Help define [**outgroup**](#outgroup) **comparison** for derived characters

- Outgroup limitations: a character can revert from a derived state back to the ancestral state

Note: derived traits are a subset of ancestral traits (derived traits are somewhat considered the ancestral traits)

- **Synapomorphy**: **derived traits** that are shared among a group of descendants and are viewed as evidence of the common ancestry of the group
  - e.g., the vertebral column is a synapomorphy(syn-: one, apo-: related to, -morphy: form) of all vertebrates when considering all animals
  - e.g., milk production is a synapomorphy of all mammals when considering all vertebrates

### Monophyletic vs Paraphyletic vs Polyphyletic

- **Monophyletic group**: a common ancestor and all of its descendants
  ![Monophyletic](./Monophyletic.png)
- **Paraphyletic group**: a common ancestor and some of its descendants
  ![Paraphyletic](./Paraphyletic.png)
- **Polyphyletic group**: does not include the common ancestor
  ![Polyphyletic](./Polyphyletic.png)

### Construction of Phylogenetic Trees

- **Principle of Parsimony**: the simplest explanation is most likely to be correct (unless other context provided)
- We assume that change is an unlikely event
  - Evolution of a character twice is extremely unlikely
  - Evolutionary trees with derived characters appearing once are most parsimonious
- Minimize the changes -> minimize the homoplasies

### What traits to use?

1. Morphological

- Most species have been described on the basis of morphological data e.g.,
  - features of skeletal system in vertebrates
  - floral structures in plants
  - external features of exoskeleton in insects
- Limitations
  - comparing distantly related species -> too different
  - some species show few morphological differences -> too similar
  - some morphological variation affected by the environment

2. Developmental

- Similarities in development patterns may reveal evolutionary relationships (look at embryos) e.g.,
  - Sea squirts and vertebrates all have a _notochord_ at some time in their development
- Limitations
  - complicated to quantify

3. Paleontological

- **Fossil** provide information about morphology of past organisms, and where and when they lived
- Important in determining _derived_ and _ancestral_ traits
- Important in determining when lineages diverged
- Limitations
  - Fossil record is fragmentary and missing for some groups

4. Behavioural

- Some behavioural traits are inherited e.g.,
  - Frog calls are genetically determined and can be used in phylogenetic trees
- Limitations
  - Some behavioural traits are culturally transmitted
  - e.g., bird songs are often learned and may not be a useful trait

5. Molecular characters

- DNA, RNA, and amino acids changes reflect evolution
- Pros:
  - Abundant data
  - Easier comparison of distant or very close relations
  - No direct environmental effect
- Cons:
  - Only four states in nucleotides, 20 in amino acids
  - Base changes may have evolved independently
- **Molecular Clocks**: the number of changes, or mutations, which accumulate in the gene sequences of different species over time is relatively constant
  - Each DNA sequence has a different clock tick
  - Molecular differences between pairs of species are proportional to the time of their separation -> used to determine the time of divergence
- Analysis of molecular characters
  - Sequence of amino acids or nucleotide bases reflects evolutionary relationships
  - Less similarities in sequence: more distant relation
  - Sequences must be aligned to the same position as mutations can change the length of DNA
  - Mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear DNA are all used
  - Comparison with reference database

### Modern approach

- Maximum likelihood & Bayesian-based tree building algorithms
  - useful when quality/quantity of data does not permit parsimony

## Speciation

### What is a species?

- Smallest independently evolving unit
- Species follow independent evolutionary trajectories
- Defining species is extraordinarily contentious
- \>20 different species concepts

Linnaeus' morphological species concept

- Linnaeus defined species based on their appearance
- Originated [binomial](#binomial-system-of-nomenclature) [system](#binomial-system-of-nomenclature) [of](#binomial-system-of-nomenclature) [nomenclature](#binomial-system-of-nomenclature)
- Idea: members of species look alike because they share many alleles
- Limitations
  - Does not reflect **sexual dimorphism**
  - Immature individuals may not look like their parents (life cycle)

More concepts

1. Biological species concept

- A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring
- Limitations
  - Species hybridize and may produce offspring
  - Plant cultivars
  - Asexual organisms e.g.,
    - an **androdioecous species**: males and hermaphrodites coexist
    - a **gynogenetic species**: embryo only contains maternal chromosomes due to activation of an egg by sperm that degenerates without fusing with the egg nucleus

2. Ecological species concept

- A species is a group of organisms that share a distinct ecological niche
- Idea: different species use ecological resources differently, to become divergent in behaviour and location
- Not commonly used

3. Phylogenetic species concept

- A species is a group of organisms bound by a unique ancestry
- Limitation
  - **Introgression** due to hybridization

Why controversial?

- Species are dynamic, evolving individuals, but we attempt to force them into rigid classes
- Life is always in transition
- All extant taxa are changing
- Nature does not conform to our boundaries of classification

### Giraffes

- 5 to 10 different subspecies of giraffes exist
- distinctions based on geographic range
- distinctions based on pelage pattern
- Some difference in pelage is not associated with geographic barriers
- Through mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis, and nuclear microsatellite loci analysis, six genealogically distinct lineages are found

### Speciation

- When gene flow is reduced between population, they may diverge genetically due to **mutation**, **natural selection**, **genetic drift**
- This genetic divergence may lead to **speciation**

### Types of Isolation

- **Prezygotic isolation**: occurs when individuals of different species are prevented from mating
  - Breed in different places
  - Breed at different times
  - Sexual selection - females only attached to same species
  - Genitalic incompatibility
- **Postzygotic isolation**: occurs when individuals from different populations do mate, but the hybrid offspring produced have low fitness and do not survive or are not fertile
  - Sterile hybride - e.g., horse + donkey = mule
  - Reduced fitness of hybrids
  - [Polyploidy](#polyploidy)
  - Limitations
    - The crieterion cannot be evaluated in fossils or in species that reproduce asexually
    - Can only applied to populations that overlap geographically ([**sympatry**](#sympatry))

#### Isolation and divergence in allopatry

- Genetic isolation happens when populations become physically separated
- Populations that live in different areas are said to be **allopatric**
- Physical isolation occurs by dispersal or vicariance (separated themselves or separated by the environment)
- **Allopatric speciation**: speciation that begins with physical isolation
- **Biogeography** can tell us how colonization and range-splitting events occur
  - **Dispersal** occurs when a population moves to a new habitat, colonizes it, and form a new population -> **gene flow** $\downarrow$, **genetic drift** via the _founder effect_ catalyzes speciation, different **natural selection** if new environment is different
  - **Vicariance** occurs when a physical barrier splits a widespread population into subgroups that are physically isolated from each other
    - Vicariance events during the last ice age, when glaciers served as physical barriers are thought to be responsible for the origin of many modern species
    - **Continental drift**: the movement of continental plates explained by the theory of plate tectonic
    - Continental drift separated species physically over the long time

#### Isolation and divergence in sympatry

- Populations or species that live in the same geographic region (close enough to mate) live in **sympatry**
- **Natural selection** can overcome **gene flow** and cause **sympatric speciation**

Example

- Hawthorn flies started laying eggs in both hawthorns and apples after the introduction of apple trees
- Hawthorns have better nutrition
- Apples have fewer parasitism
- **Disruptive selection** occured and ended up with the creation of apple maggot flies
- Hawthorn maggot flies and apple maggot flies prefer to mate on hawthorn fruit and apple fruit, respectively
- They still can mate -> no speciation yet

### Polypoidy leading to speciation

- For example, tetraploid individuals are genetically isolated from wild-type individuals because they produce diploid gametes rathe rthan haploid gametes
- If these gametes combined, the resulting zygote would be triploid
- Triploid individuals produce gametes with a dysfunctional set of chromosomes e.g., seedless bananas

Autopolyploidy

- Chromosome duplications within a species
- Unreduced gametes receive same _n_ as somatic cell, error in meiosis
- Odd chromosome numbers usually sterile (except plants and fungi)

Allopolyploidy

- Chromosome duplications between species
- Doubling of hybrid species chromosomes make them fertile

Evolution of Wheat

- Diploid wild wheat, _Triticum monococcum_, has two sets of 7 chromosomes (14AA)
- Long ago, _T. monococcum_ hybridized with another species that had the same number of chromosomes (14BB)
- The AB hybrid offspring were sterile (14AB)
- Polyploidy arose in the hybrids (28AABB), and they are fertile because at meiosis, A chromosomes pair with each other and B chromosomes pair with each other
- Later, 28AABB hyberdized with _T.tauschii_ (14DD)
- The hybrid descendants (42AABBDD) include common bread wheats, such as _T. aestivum_

### Chromosome alterations

- Closely related species often differ in chromosomal arrangement
- Chromosomal rearrangements lead to higher rates of protein evolutionary divergence
  - **Inversions**: breakage, rearrangement withint itself
  - **Translocations**: exchange between non-homologous chromosomes
  - **Deletions**: mutation leading to loss of nucleotides
  - **Duplications**: part of chromosomes duplicated
- Fast speciation

### When isolated populations come into contact

Divergence

- If two populations have diverged and if divergence has affected when, where, or how individuals in the populations mate, **prezygotic isolation** exists
- Then, mating between the populations is rare, gene flow is minimal, and continue to diverge

Introgression

- With no **prezygotic isolation**, populations may interbreed
- **Introgression**: gene flow then occurs and may erase distinctions between the two populations

Development of Hybrid zones

- Sometimes the hybrid offspring of related species possess traits that are intermediate between the two parental populations, healthy and capable of breeding
- **Hybrid zone**: a geographic area where interbreeding between two populations occur and hybrid offspring are common

Reinforcement

- If two populations of related species have diverged extensively and are distinct genetically, their hybrid offspring will most likely have lower fitness and will not develop or reproduce normally
- **postzygotic isolation**
- Strong natural selection against interbreeding
- **Reinforcement**: selection for traits that isolate populations reproductively
- **Sympatric** species that are close relatives living in the same area are rarely willing to mate with one another
- **Allopatric** species that are close relatives living in different areas are often willing to mate with one another

Others

- Reinforcement
- Speciation by hybridization
