## Cell Structure and Components

### Core Concepts

1. **Cell membranes**
   - composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates
2. **The plasma membrane**
   - a selective barrier
   - controls the movement of molecules between the inside and the outside of the cell
3. **The endomembrane system**
   - interconnected system of membranes
   - e.g., nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparartus, lysosomes, vesicles, and plasma membrane
4. **Mitochondria and Chloroplasts**
   - Organelles involved in energy harvesting
   - Evolved from free-living prokaryotes

### Cell Theory

- All organisms are made up of cells
- The cell is the fundamental unit of life
- Cells come from pre-existing cells

### Cell Membranes

Phospholipids

- Polar head group (glycerol backbone, phosphate, choline) is hydrophilic
- Fatty acid chains are hydrophobic
- -> Phospholipids are **amphipathic**

Lipid Structures

- **Micelle**: Large head and bulky with one hydrophobic tail buried
- **Bilayer**: Small head with two hydrophobic tails
- **Liposome**: Encoled bilayers composed of phospholipids

Cholesterol

- Component of _animal_ cell membranes
- A buffer to lessen the impact of the temperature on membrane fluidity

Membrane Proteins

- **Receptors**: allow the cell to receive signals from the environment
- **Enzymes**: catalyze chemical reactions
- **Anchors**: attach to another proteins that help maintain cell structure and shape
  ![Membrane_Proteins](./Membrane_Protein.png)
- **Integral Membrane Proteins**: permanently associated with cell membranes
- **Peripheral Membrane Proteins**: temporarily associated with lipid bilayer or with integral membrane proteins through weak noncovalent interactions

- **Transporters**: move ions or molecules across the membrane
  ![Transporters](./Transporters.png)

### The Plasma Membranes

Diffusion

- The simplest movement into and out of cells
- Passive transport
- **Simple Diffusion**: direct transport of molecules allowed by the cell membrane
- **Facilitated Diffusion**: assisted transport of molecules through the action of transmembrane proteins such as carriers and channels

Osmosis

- Diffusion of water
- Effects of osmosis
  ![Effects_of_Osmosis](./Effects_of_Osmosis.png)

### Plant Cell Wall and Vacuoles

Vacuole

- Storage of water and nutrients
- Storage and disposal of waste products and
- Supported by **turgor pressure**: force exerted by water pressing against an object

### Types of Transport

Passive Transport

- Does not require energy
- Diffusion, Osmosis
- Through concentration gradient

Active Transport

- Requires energy
- **Primary Active Transport**
  - Move molecules in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient
  - The pumps are the **antiporter**
  - The transporters that move two molecules in the same direction are called **symporters** or **co-transporters**
- **Secondary Active Transport**
  - Movement of the coupled molecules is driven by the movement of protins, not direct ATP
  - Protons are pumped out of the cell by primary active transport
  - Electrochemical gradient from outside to inside the cell is now generated by protons
  - The antiporter move a different molecule out of the cell against its concentration gradient

### The Endomembrane System

- **Exocytosis**: vesicles generated from the endomembrane system fusing with the plasma membrane to deliver its contents into the extracellular space
- **Endocytosis**: material from outside the cell being brought into a vesicle

The Nuclear Envelope

- **Nuclear Pores**: membrane protein openings on the nuclear envelope -> essential for the nucleus to communicate with the rest of the cell
- Small molecules (e.g., ions) can passively diffuse through the pores
- Large protines and RNA require active transport
  ![Nuclear_Envelope](./Nulcear_Envelope.png)

The Endoplasmic Reticulum

- Largest organelle in most eukaryotic cells
- Factory of lipids and proteins
- **Rough ER**: lots of ribosomes (reason for its name), synthesize proteins
- **Smooth ER**: lacks ribosomes, synthesize lipids
- **Ribosomes**: site of protein synthesis, amino acids are assembled into polypeptides

The Golgi Apparatus

- Modify proteins and lipids produced in the ER
- Sort proteins and lipids as they move to their final destinations (providing pathway)
- Synthesize carbohydrates

Lysosomes

- Degrade proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and complex carbohydrates e.g., worn-out organelle
- Fuse with macromolecule that needs to be broken down
- Maintain acidic pH through proton pumps
- Useful broken-down molecules are recycled
- Waste molecules are expelled from cell

### Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

- Contain their own genomes
- Grow and multiply independently of other membrane compartments
