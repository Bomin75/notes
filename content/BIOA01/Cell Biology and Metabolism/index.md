## Cell Structure and Components

### Core Concepts

1. **Cell membranes**
   - composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates
2. **The plasma membrane**
   - a selective barrier
   - controls the movement of molecules between the inside and the outside of the cell
3. **The endomembrane system**
   - interconnected system of membranes
   - e.g., nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparartus, lysosomes, vesicles, and plasma membrane
4. **Mitochondria and Chloroplasts**
   - Organelles involved in energy harvesting
   - Evolved from free-living prokaryotes

### Cell Theory

- All organisms are made up of cells
- The cell is the fundamental unit of life
- Cells come from pre-existing cells

### Cell Membranes

Phospholipids

- Polar head group (glycerol backbone, phosphate, choline) is hydrophilic
- Fatty acid chains are hydrophobic
- -> Phospholipids are **amphipathic**

Lipid Structures

- **Micelle**: Large head and bulky with one hydrophobic tail buried
- **Bilayer**: Small head with two hydrophobic tails
- **Liposome**: Encoled bilayers composed of phospholipids

Cholesterol

- Component of _animal_ cell membranes
- A buffer to lessen the impact of the temperature on membrane fluidity
  ![Cholesterol_Fluidity](./Cholesterol_Fluidity.png)

Membrane Proteins

- **Receptors**: allow the cell to receive signals from the environment
- **Enzymes**: catalyze chemical reactions
- **Anchors**: attach to another proteins that help maintain cell structure and shape
  ![Membrane_Proteins](./Membrane_Protein.png)
- **Integral Membrane Proteins**: permanently associated with cell membranes
- **Peripheral Membrane Proteins**: temporarily associated with lipid bilayer or with integral membrane proteins through weak noncovalent interactions
  ![Integral_Peripheral](./Integral_Peripheral_Membrane_Proteins.png)
- **Transporters**: move ions or molecules across the membrane
  ![Transporters](./Transporters.png)

### The Plasma Membranes

Diffusion

- The simplest movement into and out of cells
- Passive transport
- **Simple Diffusion**: direct transport of molecules allowed by the cell membrane
- **Facilitated Diffusion**: assisted transport of molecules through the action of transmembrane proteins such as carriers and channels

Osmosis

- Diffusion of water
- Effects of osmosis
  ![Effects_of_Osmosis](./Effects_of_Osmosis.png)

### Plant Cell Wall and Vacuoles

Vacuole

- Storage of water and nutrients
- Storage and disposal of waste products and
- Supported by **turgor pressure**: force exerted by water pressing against an object

### Types of Transport

Passive Transport

- Does not require energy
- Diffusion, Osmosis
- Through concentration gradient

Active Transport

- Requires energy
- **Primary Active Transport**
  - Move molecules in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient
  - The pumps are the **antiporter**
  - The transporters that move two molecules in the same direction are called **symporters** or **co-transporters**
- **Secondary Active Transport**
  - Movement of the coupled molecules is driven by the movement of protins, not direct ATP
  - Protons are pumped out of the cell by primary active transport
  - Electrochemical gradient from outside to inside the cell is now generated by protons
  - The antiporter move a different molecule out of the cell against its concentration gradient

### The Endomembrane System

- **Exocytosis**: vesicles generated from the endomembrane system fusing with the plasma membrane to deliver its contents into the extracellular space
- **Endocytosis**: material from outside the cell being brought into a vesicle

The Nuclear Envelope

- **Nuclear Pores**: membrane protein openings on the nuclear envelope -> essential for the nucleus to communicate with the rest of the cell
- Small molecules (e.g., ions) can passively diffuse through the pores
- Large protines and RNA require active transport
  ![Nuclear_Envelope](./Nulcear_Envelope.png)

The Endoplasmic Reticulum

- Largest organelle in most eukaryotic cells
- Factory of lipids and proteins
- **Rough ER**: lots of ribosomes (reason for its name), synthesize proteins
- **Smooth ER**: lacks ribosomes, synthesize lipids
- **Ribosomes**: site of protein synthesis, amino acids are assembled into polypeptides

The Golgi Apparatus

- Modify proteins and lipids produced in the ER
- Sort proteins and lipids as they move to their final destinations (providing pathway)
- Synthesize carbohydrates

Lysosomes

- Degrade proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and complex carbohydrates e.g., worn-out organelle
- Fuse with macromolecule that needs to be broken down
- Maintain acidic pH through proton pumps
- Useful broken-down molecules are recycled
- Waste molecules are expelled from cell

### Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

- Contain their own genomes
- Grow and multiply independently of other membrane compartments

## Metabolism and Cell Energy

### Microbiome

- Consists of microbes that are helpful or harmful
- The microbiome associated with the human body has more cells than human cells
- Most are mutualists and commensals
- In smaller numbers are pathogens (promoting disease)

Age

- Different age provides different microbiome profile

## Chemical Reactions an Enzymes

Core Concepts

1. **Chemical Reactions**: involve the breaking and forming of bonds
2. **Energetic Coupling**: spontaneous reactions drive a non-spontaneous reactions
3. **Enzymes**: protein catalysts that can increase the rate of biochemical reactions
4. **Allosteric Enzymes**: an enzyme that is activated or inhibited when binding to another moecule changes its shape

### Chemical Reactions

- Catabolic reactions + Anabolic reactions

Free Radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species)

- Free radicals steal electrons
- Normal cells get damaged under oxidative stress due to free radicals
- Consumption of antioxidants can prevent it e.g., Selenium
- Selenoprotein translation generates proteins with selenocysteine that contain abundant selenium

Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$)

- Energonic reaction: reactions with a positive $\Delta G$, require input of energy
- Exergonic reaction: reactions with a negative $\Delta G$, release energy

Energy Available
$$\text{Total Energy} (H)=\text{energy available to do work} + \text{energy lost to entropy}$$
$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$

Gibbs Energy in different reactions

- Catabolic reaction:
  $$\Delta G \downarrow = \Delta H \downarrow  - T\Delta S \uparrow$$
- Anabolic reaction:
  $$\Delta G \uparrow = \Delta H \uparrow - T\Delta S \downarrow$$

### Energetic Coupling

- A process in which spontaneous reactions ($\Delta G<0$) drive a non-spontaneous reaction ($\Delta G > 0$)

e.g.,
![Energetic_Coupling](./Energetic_Coupling1.png)
Note that the two reactions share $P_i$, resulting in a coupled reaction

![Energetic_Coupling2](./Energetic_Coupling2.png)
Note that the entire process is still considered spontaneous as the Gibbs free energy is negative after driving the energonic reaction

Intermediate Free Energy
- ATP: energy provider
![Intermediate_Free_Energy](./Intermediate_Free_Energy.png)

Rate of a Reaction
- Transition state: unstable, has large energy
- Note that reactants require an activation energy, denoted $E_A$, to enter the transition state

### Enzymes
Protein catalysts that can increase the rate of biochemical reactions

- Enzyme-Catalzed Reactions
$$\text{Substrate} (S) \leftrightarrow \text{Product} (P)$$
$$S + \text{Enzyme} (E) \leftrightarrow ES \leftrightarrow EP \leftrightarrow E + P$$

Enzyme Shape
- **Active site** binds the **substrate** and converts it to the product
- Interaction between the substrate and the active site **decreases** the **activate energy** required

Active Site Formation
- The amino acids that form the active site are often composed of non-linear sequence of the unfolded enzyme
- Often specific for substrates (**Enzyme Specificity**)

Activators & Inhibitors
- **Activators**: activate/promote enzyme activities
- **Inhibitors**: 
  - binds to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate to reduce the rate of reaction
  - binds to the allosteric site of the **allosteric enzymes** to alter the shape of the enzyme and prevent substrate bindings

Why are some mushrooms toxic to human beings?
- **Amatoxins** are selective inhibitors of RNA polymerase II, which is a vital enzyme in the synthesis of mRNA, microRNA, and snRNA

### Allosteric Enzymes
Regulation of Chemical Reactions
- **Allosteric Enzyme**: an enzyme activated or inhibited by the change of shape resulting from the bindings of other molecules
