- **Cell plate** forms to divide the cytoplasm

### Meiotic Cell Division

- Essential for sexual reproduction, the production of offspring that combine gneetic mateirla from two parents
- Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate
- Meiosis II, sister chromatids separate
- Results in four daughter cells
- Each daughter cell contains a half number of chromosomes as in the parent cell
- Each daughter cell is genetically unique

#### Meiosis I

- **Reductional division** as the number of chromosomes in daughter cells are reduced by half
- the centromeres do not split during this stage of meiosis

#### Prophase I

- Chromosomes become visible as thin threads (DNA replication is complete)
- Homologous chromosomes condense, undergo synapsis (gene-for-gene pairing)
- Each pair of homologous chromosomes forms a bivalent (each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids)
- Chromosomes shorten and thicken
- Nuclear envelope break down

#### Crossing Over

- Meiosis allows homologous chromosomes of maternal and paternal origin to undergo an exchange of DNA sements
- Contribute to the genetic variation
- Crossing over also helpes hold together the bivalents for metaphase I
  ![CrossingOver](./CrossingOver.png)

#### Prometaphase I

- Spindles attach to kinetochores on chromosomes

#### Metaphase I

- Homologous pairs line up in center of cell, with bivalents oriented randomly with respect to each other
- Contribute to the genetic variation

#### Anaphase I

- Homologous chromosomes separate, but sister chromatids do not

#### Telophase I

- Reformation of nucleus envlope

#### Cytokinesis

- Separation of cytoplasm

#### Meiosis II

- The process resembles mitosis except phrophase II (have haploid, not diploid)
- No DNA synthesis between two meiotic divisions
- Meiosis II is called **equational division** because cells in meiosis II have the same number of chromosomes in the beginning and in the end

Mitosis vs. Meiosis

- During meiosis I, maternal and paternal homologs separate from each other
- During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate from each other (similar to mitosis)

Cytoplasmic Division

- In females, the cytoplasm is divided very unequally in both meiotic divisions to form an egg
- In males, the cytoplasm divides fairly equally, resulting in products of functional sperms
  ![CytoplasmicDivisionFemaleMale](./CytoplamicDivision_FemaleMale.png)
  Note that the original number of chrosomomes (2n) is restored through the formation of zygote as a result of combination between Oocyte and a sperm cell

## Regulation of Cell Cycle and Cancer

Core Concepts

1. **Nondisjunction** results in extra or missing chromosomes
2. **Cell cycle regulation**: the cell cycle is regulated so that cell division occurs only at appropriate times and places
3. **Cancer** is uncontrolled cell division that results from mutations in genes that control cell division

### Nondisjunction

- results in extra or missing chromosomes

First-division

- Result in gametes with an extra or missing chromosome
  ![First-division](./First-division-nondisjunction.png)

Second-division

- REsults in gametes with an extra chromosome, a missing chromosome, and normal numbers of chromosomes
  ![Second-division](./Second_division_nondisjunction)

Trisomy 21: Down Syndrome

- Three 21 chromosomes present

Nondisjunction in species with different reproduction strategies
![nondisjunctions](./nondisjunctions.png)

### Cell cycle regulation

- The cell cycle is regulated so that cell division only occurs when and where appropriate

Regulation

- Cell division cannot occur all the time because uncontrolled division is dangerous and can lead to cancer
- The proteins that appear and disappear cyclically are called **cyclins**
  ![Cyclins](./cyclins.png)
- Enzymes activated by cyclins are called **cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)**
- Once the CDK are activated by cyclins, cell division is promoted

Cyclin level through the Cell Cycle
![Cycline_Level](./Cyclin_Level.png)

Cyclin-CDK Complexes

- Cyciln D and E -CDK are actie at the end of G1
  - Promotes the expression of histone proteins
- Cyclin A-CDK is involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis
  - Prevents the reassembling of the same proteins and re-replicating the same DNA
- Cycling B-CDK, initiates multiple events associated with mitosis
  - Breakdown of the nuclear envelope during prophase
  - Formation of mitotic spindles
    ![Cyclin_Levels_per_phase](./Cyclin_level_per_phase.png)

Checkpoints
![Checkpoints](./Checkpoints.png)

DNA Damage Checkpoints
![DNA_Damage_Checkpoints](./DNA_Damage_Checkpoint.png)

- This arrests the cell at the G1/S transition, giving the cell time to repair the DNA damange

### Cancer

- uncontrolled cell division that results form mutations in genes that control cell division
  ![Cancer_cell_division](./Cancer_Cell_division.png)

Cancer and oncogenes

- **Proto-oncogenes**: normal genes that are important in cell division that have the potential to become cancerous if mutated (can be mutated by cancer-causing agents)
- **Oncogene**: cancer-causing gene
- **Tumor suppressors**: encode proteins whose normal activities inhibit cell division

Cancer causing agents

- Virus
  ![Virus_causing_Cancer](./Virus_causing_cancer.png)
  - Cancerous viral RNA is injected to the host genome
- Pathogens
  ![Pathogen_causing_cancer](./pathogens_causing_cancers.png)
  - Helicobactor Pylori is a cancer-causing bacteria
  - HBV, HCV, and HPV are cancer-causing virus

Multiple-Mutation Model for Cancer Development
![Multiple_mutation_model](./Multiple-mutation_model.png)

Types of Cancer Treatment

- Hormone therapy
- Surgery
- Bone Marrow Transplantation
- Chemotherapy
- Targeted theraphy
- Radiation therapy
- Immunotherapy
- Note that cancer is difficult to treat as it begins from healthy cells -> challenge is to selectively kill the affected cells

Fungus, Cordycepin, NUC-7738

- Cordycepin inhibits DEK

Medicinal mushroms

- The Jack-o-Lantern fungus is bioluminescent (the glow "foxfire")
- Poisonous but the source of a new cancer drug in clinical trials

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)

- CRISPR can be used to fight against cancer
  ![CRISPR_as_treatment](./CRISPR_cancer.png)
- Modify the T-cells with CRISPR
  -NY-ESO-1 TCR precisely recognizes the cancer cell

Comparison of Mitosis and Meiosis
![Mitosis_vs_Meiosis](./Comparison_of_Mitosis_and_Meiosis.png)

## Fungal Cells

Core Concepts

1. FUngi are **heterotrophic eukaryotes** that feed by absorption
2. Fungi reproduces both **sexually and asexually**, and disperse by **spores**

### Fungi

- Fungi are responsible for
  - the **decomposition** of plants and animal tissues
  - locate and break down the complex molecules and bulky tissues
  - **cycle carbon**
- **Heterotrophs**: depend on pre-existing organic molecules for carbon and energy
- Release enzymes to break down complex organic molecules e.g., starch, cellulose, and lignin
- Absorb the digested organic molecules directly through their cell walls

![Fungal_Hyphae](./Fungal_hyphae.png)

#### Fungal Hyphae

- Most fungi are multicellular
- Consist of highly branched filaments, **hyphae**
- No mode of locomotion
- Use growth to find nourishment
- **Mycelium**: a network of branching hyphae

Hyphal Growth
![Hyphal_Growth](./Hyphal_Growth.png)

#### Material Transport

- Cell walls are made of **chitin**, the same compound found in the exoskeleton of insects
- Can transport **food** and **signaling molecules** across long distances in **mycelia**, driven by changes in **turgor pressure**
- Differences in turgor pressure along hyphae drive bulk flow (similar to phloem transport)
  ![Material_Transport](./Material_Transport.png)
  - Allows hyphae to use materials in nutrient-rich locations to fuel hyphal elongation across nutrient-poor locations
- In some early-diverging groups, the hyphae have many nuclei but no cell walls to separate them
- In more advanced groups, nuclear divisions are accompanied by the formation of **septa**, walls partially divide the cytoplasm into separate cells

#### Septa variation

- Plugs are developed to regulate the nutrient flow
  ![Septa_variation](./Septa_Variation.png)

#### Yeast

- **Yeasts** are single-celled fungi
- Foundin moist nutrient-rich environments
- Divide by budding
  ![Budding_in_Yeast](./Budding_in_Yeast.png)
- Common on the surface of plants, and to a lesser extent on the surfaces and in the gut of animals

#### Decomposition

- Most fungi use dead organic matter as their source of energy and raw materials
- Bacteria and some protists can also subsist on dead organic matter but it is mostly fungi that decompose them back to carbon dioxide and water

#### Fungal Infections in Living Tissues

- Plants are vulnerable to a diverse array of fungal pathogens
  - e.g., rusts, smuts, and molds that cause huge losses in agricultural production
- Aboveground, infection is transmitted by fungal spores
- Belowground, infection is transmitted by hyphae that penetrate the root

#### Fungal Infections in Invertebrates

- Insects and other invertebrates are susceptible to fungal pathogens

#### Fungal Infections in Vertebrates

- Rare in vertebrates
- Severe infections are more frequent among fish and amphibians than in mammals

#### Fungus as a pathogen

- Mucormycosis caused a fungal disease (Mucorales)
- It is difficult for the fungi to meet the virulence factors
  ![Virulence_Factors](./Virulence.png)

#### Mutualistic Relationships (Mycorrhizal)

- Mycorrhizal fungi suuply plant roots with nutrients e.g., phosphorus from the soil
- In return, receives carbohydrates from their host
- Two main types: **ectomycorrhiza**, **endomycorrhiza**
  ![Mycorrhizal](./Mycorrhizal.png)
- Ectomycorrhiza fungi do not penetrate
- Endomycorrhiza (Arbuscular mycorrhiza) penetrate into the root cells and produce **arbuscules** -> increase surface area for exchange of materials

#### Mutualistic Relationships (Endophytes)

- Fungi called endophytes live within leaves and grow within cell walls and in the spaces between cells -> mutualistic
- The insects provide the fungi with shelter, food, and protection from predators and pathogens
- Fungi are used as a food source for the insect

#### Mutualistic Relationships (Lichens)

- **Lichens** are associations between fungi and photosynthetic microorganisms e.g., green algae, cyanobacteria -> mutualistic
  ![Lichen_Structure](./Lichen_Structure.png)
- The hyphae anchor the lichen to a rock or tree, aid in the uptake and retention of water and nutrients
- The photosynthetic partners provide a source of reduced carbon e.g., carbohydrates
- Cyanobacteria living in lichens provide a source of nitrogen e.g., ammonia
- Fungi and photosynthetic microorganisms exchange nutrients through fungal hyphae that tightly encircle or event penetrate the walls of the photosynthetic cells
- Lichens spread asexually by
  - Fragmentation
  - The formation of dispersal units consisting of a single photosynthetic cell surrounded by hyphae
    ![Lichen_Dispersal](./Lichen_Dispersal.png)

### Spore Dispersal

- Fungi face two challenges in completing their life cycles:
  - Maintaining genetic diversity: must find other individuals to mate with
  - Dispersal: must be able to disperse from one place to another
- The probability of any given spore landing on a favourable habitat is low -> produce huge number of spores
- Spores allow fungi to use resources that are patchy in time and in space

#### Asexual Spore Dispersal

- A moldy pieces of bread reveals that the surface is covered with **hyphae** carrying **sporangia** containing asexual spores
- In many species, asexual spores are produced within sporangia that form at the ends of erect hyphae, facilitating the release of the spores into the air

![Asexual_Spore_Dispersal](./Asexual_Dispersal.png)

Fruiting bodies

- Some fungi rely on external agents such as raindrops or animals to move their spores around

![Bird_nest_fungus](./Bird's-nest_fungus.png)

#### Fungal Life Cycle

- In most fungi, the sexual phase of the life cycle involves the fusion of hyphal tips rather than specialized reproductive cells, or gametes
- In fungi, the fusion of haploid cells is not immediately followed by the fusion of their nuclei
- Haploid nuclei retain their independent identities, resulting in a **heterokaryotic** stage
- The cytoplasmic union of two cells (**plasmogamy**) is not always followed immediately by the fusion of their nuclei (**karyogamy**)
  ![Fungal_Life_Cycle](./Fungal_Life_Cycle.png)

#### Parasexual Cycle

- **Parasexual** fungal species lack an observable sexual cycle
- Use another mechanism of generating genetic diversity
  - The crossing over of DNA during mitosis
- The haploid chromosome number is restored not by meiotic division, but by the progressive loss of chromosomes
- The key difference is that parasexual species do not undergo meiosis
  ![Parasexual_Cycle](./Parasexual_Cycle.png)

## Fungal Diversity

Core Concept

- Other than animals, fungi are the most diverse group of eukaryotes

Fungal Phylogeny
![Fungal_Phylogeny](./Fungal_Phylogeny.png)

### Chytrids

- Most chytrids are decomposers
- A few are pathogens of algae or vascular plants
- Many chytrids are single cells with walls or chitin
- Chytrids do not form a true mycelium

### Zygomycetes (Zoopagomycota + Mucoromycota)

#### Zoopagomycota

- Constitutes the earliest zygomycetes
- Contains species that are primarily parasites and pathogens of small animals and other fungi i.e., mycoparasites
- _Orphella_:
  ![Orphella](./Orphella.png)

#### Mucoromycota

- Characterized by plant associations and plant-based ecologies
  - Mycorrhizae
  - Root endophytes
  - Decomposers
- _Pilobolus_: can forcibly eject the entire sporangium rather than releasing individual spores
  ![Pilobolus](./Pilobolus.png)
- Fungal Highway _Mucor_: promote the growth of bacteria, mucorales species impact human beings beneficially through their use in food industry
- _Glomeromycetes_: a monophyletic group within Mucoromycota
  - Almost all occur in association with plant roots with tremendous ecological importance

#### Dikarya

- Key feature: every mitotic division is accompanied by the formation of a new septum
- Allows fungi to control the number of nuclei within each cell
- Proliferate in the dikaryotic state
- Contains two monophyletic subgroups:

  - Ascomycetes: meiosis is followed by a single round of mitosis, resulting in **asci** that contain eight haploid dspores
  - Basidiomycetes: fruiting bodies
    - Life cycle is similar to that of ascomycetes with some exceptions
      - fruiting body entirely made up of dikaryotic hyphae
      - nuclear fusion takes place in a specialized cell called a **basidium**
      - haploid products of meiosis do not undergo mitosis
      - **Clamp formation**: ensure that each cell is dikaryotic
    - Live by forming ectomycorrhizal associations or by decomposing wood and other substrates
    - The multicellular fruiting bodies produced by some fungi facilitate the dispersal of sexually produced spores
    - Fruiting bodies are highly ordered and compact structures compared to the mycelia from which they grow

- A novel floral mimicry system by _Fusarium_ fungi
  ![Furasium](./Fusarium.png)
- Here, only D is a healthy flower
