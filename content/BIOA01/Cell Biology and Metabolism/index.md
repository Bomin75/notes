- Consumption of antioxidants can prevent it e.g., Selenium
- Selenoprotein translation generates proteins with selenocysteine that contain abundant selenium

Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$)

- Exergonic reaction: reactions with a negative $\Delta G$, release energy

Energy Available
$$\text{Total Energy} (H)=\text{energy available to do work} + \text{energy lost to entropy}$$
$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$

Gibbs Energy in different reactions

- Catabolic reaction:
  $$\Delta G \downarrow = \Delta H \downarrow  - T\Delta S \uparrow$$
- Anabolic reaction:
  $$\Delta G \uparrow = \Delta H \uparrow - T\Delta S \downarrow$$

### Energetic Coupling

- A process in which spontaneous reactions ($\Delta G<0$) drive a non-spontaneous reaction ($\Delta G > 0$)

e.g.,
![Energetic_Coupling](./Energetic_Coupling1.png)
Note that the two reactions share $P_i$, resulting in a coupled reaction

![Energetic_Coupling2](./Energetic_Coupling2.png)
