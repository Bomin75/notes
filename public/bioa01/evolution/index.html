<main><p>Life displays great diversity with 10 million or more species. The unity and the diversity of life are explained by <strong>evolution</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-evolution">Introduction to Evolution</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-evolution">What is Evolution?</h3>
<p>Basic Definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change through time</li>
<li>Decent with motification</li>
<li>Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pangenesis&rdquo;: proposal that each part of the body continually emits small particles called gemmules that contribute to the heritable information to the gametes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biological</strong> Definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change in allele or genotype frequencies in populations over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution occurs in <strong>populations</strong></li>
<li>Evolution <strong>does not</strong> occur in an individual</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adaptive-radiation">Adaptive Radiation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organism diversify rapidly from an acestral species when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental <a href="#niche" >niche</a>
</li>
<li>e.g. Hawaiian Drosophila radiation: alleles and genotypes of Drosophila shift through times as volcanic islands form, are observed through phenotypes, and evolve by natural selection</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-evolution-affect-our-lives">How does Evolution affect our lives?</h3>
<p><strong>Penicillin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product of <em>Penicillium</em> mold (Alexander Fleming, 1928)</li>
<li>Represents an evolved response to bacteria</li>
<li>First antibiotic drug based on a naturally occuring substance</li>
<li>Four years of of use -&gt; <em>Staphylococcus</em> strains resistant went up to 14%</li>
<li>By 1950, resistant became more than 50%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Penicillin: today</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to develop new strains of penicillin</li>
<li>Identify and locate resistance</li>
<li>Need to minimize dependence on antibiotics</li>
<li>Resistant bacteria still kills 30,000 to 40,000 Americans each year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mutations lead to variations, which can exceptionally be problematic</li>
<li>Properties of variants: <a href="#virulence" >virulence</a>
, dispersal, symptoms</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="micro-vs-macro">Micro vs Macro</h3>
<p><strong>Microevolution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes within a species</li>
<li>Caused by natural selection or evolutionary forces</li>
<li>Depends on heritable variation in genetics of a <a href="#population" >population</a>
</li>
<li><strong>Traits</strong> can be under strong natural selection e.g. antibiotic resistance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Macroevolution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes between species</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microevolution">Microevolution</h2>
<h3 id="phenotypic-variation">Phenotypic Variation</h3>
<p>Heritable variation in appearance and/or function</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Qualitative variation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrete characteristics</li>
<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: distinct variatns of character</li>
<li>e.g. two-spot ladybug</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantitative variation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous and measurable characteristics</li>
<li>Controlled by multiple genes</li>
<li>e.g. height</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Phenotypic Variation</p>
<ul>
<li>European Garden Snails vary in colour as there is no selective pressure acting on it. In a hypothetical situation, the population can converge towards a brown-coloured snails if the predators evolve to detect the bright colours better.</li>
<li>Bahamian Land Snails are under a strong selective pressure, having only a few, non-distinguishable phenotypic variation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors of the Phenotypic Variation</p>
<ul>
<li>Phenotypic variation is due to <strong>genetics (genotype)</strong>, <strong>environment</strong>, or <strong>both</strong></li>
<li>Only genetic component of phenotype are heritable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phenotypic-variation-experiment">Phenotypic Variation Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Keep Genetics constant (e.g. clone), Vary Environment</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The clour of Hydrangeas vary depending on the pH of soil (acidic: blue, basic: pink)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Breeding and Selection</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Important as evolution can only act on heritable variation</li>
<li>Artificially selected mouse with higher activity level (experimental lines) and compared with control lines (no artificial selection) -&gt; found out that there was underlying genetic variation for activity level</li>
<li><strong>Mandelian genetics</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="genetic-variation">Genetic Variation</h3>
<p>Causes</p>
<ol>
<li>New alleles from mutations</li>
<li>Recombination: from crossing over, independent assortment, random fertilization</li>
</ol>
<p>Types</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Germ-line mutations</strong>: occur in the reproductive cells -&gt; inherited</li>
<li><strong>Somatic mutations</strong>: occur in the non-reproductive cells -&gt; does not get inherited</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="population-genetics">Population Genetics</h3>
<p>The study of patterns in genetic variation in populations</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals within a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur</li>
<li>Individuals within a population are closely related to each other than members of other populations</li>
<li>Different populations of the same species may be isolated from each other such that gene flow is rare</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gene Pool</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population</li>
<li>Characterizes a population&rsquo;s genetic makeup</li>
<li>Used to identify the genotypes and calculate <strong>genotype frequencies</strong></li>
<li>Given that species is diploids and have two alleles of each gene, we can calculate <strong>allele frequencies</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evolutionary-agents">Evolutionary Agents</h2>
<h3 id="genotypes-and-alleles">Genotypes and Alleles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genotype frequency</strong>: the % of individuals in a population with a specific genotype -&gt; shows the distribution of allele combinations in a population</li>
<li><strong>Allele frequency</strong>: the % of all copies of a certain gene in a population that carry a specific allele -&gt; shows the distribution of genetic variation in a population</li>
<li>Evolution is measured as changes in <strong>allele frequencies</strong> in populations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="computing-frequencies">Computing Frequencies</h3>
<p>Notations
$$p=\text{frequency of one allele}$$
$$q=\text{frequency of another allele}$$
$$p+q=1 \text{ (normalization)}$$</p>
<p>Genotype Frequencies of the Next Genetation</p>
<p>Assuming that the population is in equilibrium for the C locus, we have
$$(p+q)\times(p+q)=p^2+2pq+q^2$$
where
$$p^2= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^R)$$
$$2pq= (\text{frequency of }C^RC^W)$$
$$q^2= (\text{frequency of }C^WC^W)$$</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li>Conisder <strong>Snapdragons</strong> that exhibit <strong>incomplete dominance</strong> with distinctive phenotype of heterozygotes</li>
<li>Let $p=0.7, q=0.3$</li>
<li>Then, expected genotype frequencies in the next generation are
$$p^2= 0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49$$
$$2pq= 2 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.42$$
$$q^2= 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$$</li>
<li>Predicted countings are 490, 420, and 90.</li>
<li>Actual countings are 410, 423, and 167, respectively</li>
<li>Thus, we can conclude that one of the Hardy-Weinberg principles is violated and the population is evolving with the selective force towards the $C^W$ allele.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-hardy-weinberg-principle">The Hardy-Weinberg Principle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null model</strong>: assume the absence of evolutionary change and compare it to the real population</li>
<li><strong>Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium</strong>: describes a population where the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remains constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mandelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work</li>
<li>The <strong>Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium</strong> occurs when the following conditions are met:
<ol>
<li><strong>No mutation</strong></li>
<li><strong>No gene flow</strong>: population is closed to migration from other populations</li>
<li><strong>Infinite population</strong></li>
<li><strong>No natural selection</strong>: all genotypes survive and reproduce equally</li>
<li><strong>Random mating</strong>: individuals mate randomly with respect to genotypes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="microevolutionary-agents">Microevolutionary Agents</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mutation</strong>: a heritable change in DNA -&gt; introduces new genetic variation into population</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Rare event, significant over long time scales</li>
<li><strong>Deleterious</strong> or <strong>lethal</strong> mutations are harmful but may persist if recessive</li>
<li><strong>Neutral mutations</strong> are neither harmful or helpful e.g. <strong>slient mutation</strong> that does not alter amino acids</li>
<li><strong>Advantageous mutations</strong> benefit an organism e.g. novel host adaptation</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gene flow</strong>: change in allele frequencies as individuals join a population and reproduce -&gt; may introduce genetic variation from another population</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>may be the movement of individuals e.g. seeds or gametes e.g. pollen</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Genetic drift</strong>: random changes in allele frequencies caused by chance events -&gt; reduces genetic variation (can eliminate in small populations)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population bottelneck</strong>: caused by catastrophic factors: diseases, starvation, drought -&gt; reduce genetic variation</li>
<li><strong>Founders effect</strong>: migrating population may not have the entire genetic variation of the parent population</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Natural selection</strong>: differential survivorship or reproduction of individuals with different genotypes -&gt; one allele may increase in frequency</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relative fitness</strong> is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contribution of others</li>
<li>Natural selection can be measured by <strong>fitness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Directional selection</strong>: favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizing selection</strong>: favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes</li>
<li><strong>Disruptive selection</strong>: favours individuals with extreme phenotypes</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Nonrandom mating</strong>: choice of mates based on their phenotypes and genotypes -&gt; does not directly affect allele frequencies but prevent genetic equilibrium</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="variation-in-populations">Variation in Populations</h3>
<h4 id="why-is-variation-beneficial-for-evolution">Why is Variation Beneficial for Evolution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Variation in populations plays a key role in <strong>natural selection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural seletion</strong> depicts that the variants with characteristics that are best applicable for an environment in terms of <strong>growth and reproduction</strong> will contribute the most to the next generation. e.g.
<ul>
<li>Farmers choosing seeds with high yield and resistency to drought and disease</li>
<li>Breeders developing different breeds of dogs e.g. terriors, huskies (Selection under domestication)</li>
<li>Rise in antibiotic resistance of disease-causing microorganisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-does-variation-occur">How does Variation Occur?</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Environmental Selection</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Occurs due to differences in the environment e.g.
<ul>
<li>Exposure to sunlight</li>
<li>Exposure to female codling moth (its egg develops into a caterpillar and eats its way into the fruit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Genetic Variation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Occurs due to differences in the genetic material e.g.
<ul>
<li>Types of apples with different tastes and color (green Granny Smith, yellow Golden Delicious, scarlet Red Delicious)</li>
<li>Individual apples within a tree (due to unique combinations of genes through fertilizaion process)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stems from genetic <strong>mutations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mutations</strong> arise from:
<ol>
<li>Random errors when passing genetic materials i.e. during DNA replication</li>
<li>Environmental factors e.g. UV radiation, cigarette smoke</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Harmful variations die out overtime</li>
<li>Beneficial veriations thrive</li>
<li>Neither can persist overtime</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolutionary-trees">Evolutionary Trees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evolution can be illustrated using a tree diagram as following. Branches represent different groups or organisms and nodes indicate the most recent common ancestor
<p class="imgp">

</li>
<li><strong>Tree of Life</strong>: the full set of evolutionary relationships along all organisms
<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Tree_Of_Life.png" alt="treeOfLife"  />
</p>
</li>
<li>Most branches on the tree of life consist of microorganisms</li>
<li>Despite that the tree shows the origin of eukarya to be archaea, biologists think it is derived by symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium</li>
<li>The order of life-forms is determined by fossils</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolution-through-experiments">Evolution through Experiments</h3>
<h4 id="can-evolution-be-demonstrated-in-the-laboratory">Can Evolution be Demonstrated in the Laboratory?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Background: In 1988, the biologist Richard Lenski grew <em>E.Coli</em> on a medium with imited amounts of glucose to observe whether they improve on their ability to metabolize glucose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypothesis: Any bacterium wiht a random mutation that increases its ability to take up glucose will reproduct at a faster rate than the other, thereby demonstrating evolution in a bacterial population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment: Cells of <em>E.Coli</em> are frozen at -80°C are kept suspended in animation, surviving without any biological processes. Starting bacteria are labeled <strong>Ancestral</strong> and the bacterial populations taken from the environment with limiting amounts, every 500 generations, of glucose were labeled <strong>Descendant</strong>. Then, compared the rate of growth of these two populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results: The growth rate of the <strong>Descendant</strong> bacterial populations became much steeper than the rate of the <strong>Ancestral</strong> in the given environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion: This experiment demonstrates that <em>E.Coli</em> evolved an improved ability to metabolize glucose overtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow-up: Later studies discovered differences in genetic makeup between <strong>Ancestral</strong> and <strong>Descendant</strong> bacterial populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application: Development of beneficial strains of microorganisms. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing toxins from lakes and rivers</li>
<li>Understand how pathogens develop resistance to drugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="genetic-variation-1">Genetic Variation</h2>
<p>In spite of a high degree of phenotypic variation, humans rank low in terms of overall genetic variation. Humans differ from each other by 1 DNA base per 1000 (99.9% identical), whereas fruit flies differ by 10 DNA bases per 1000 (99% identical).</p>
<p>Note that both genotype and environment contribute to the phenotype of an individual, which makes it hard for us to compare genetic variation directly. We can achieve this through DNA sequencing.</p>
<h3 id="population-genetics-1">Population Genetics</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-species">What is a species?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A group of individuals that are capable of sharing alleles</li>
<li>Each individual represents different combinations of alleles drawn from the <a href="#gene-pool" >gene pool</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-population-genetics">What is Population Genetics?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The study of genetic variation in natural <a href="#populations" >populations</a>
</li>
<li>This discipline answers the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Which factors determine the amount of variation in a population and in a species?</li>
<li>Why are humans genetically less variable than fruit flies?</li>
<li>Which factors affect the distribution of particular variations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sources-of-genetic-variation">Sources of Genetic Variation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mutation</strong>: generates new alleles</p>
<p>Mutation by effective range</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Somatic mutation</strong>: occur in the body&rsquo;s tissues in nonreproductive cells
<ul>
<li>Only affects one individual</li>
<li>e.g. skin cancer due to somatic mutation is not inherited</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Germ-line mutation</strong>: occur in the reproductive cells i.g. sperms, eggs
<ul>
<li>Appear in every cell of an offspring</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutation by effects on an organism</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neutral mutation</strong>: despite every human naturally having around 60 new mutations, most of them have little to no effect as a large part of genome consists of noncoding DNA</li>
<li><strong>Deleterious mutation</strong>: most of mutations occuring in protein-coding regions have a harmful effect</li>
<li><strong>Advantageous mutation</strong>: delivers a beneficial effect, rarely occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recombination</strong>: shuffles mutations and generates new permutations, followed by segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic cell division</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="measuring-genetic-variation">Measuring Genetic Variation</h2>
<p>The goal of <strong>population genetics</strong> is to <strong>infer the evolutionary process</strong> from patterns of genetic variation in nature. Thus, the rates of occurrence of alleles in populations play a key role.</p>
<h3 id="allele-frequencies">Allele Frequencies</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-allele-frequency">What is Allele Frequency?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>allele frequency</strong> of an allele <em>x</em> is the number of <em>x</em>&rsquo;s present in the population divided by the total number of alleles e.g.
<ul>
<li>Given 50% <em>aa</em>, 25% <em>Aa</em>, 25% <em>AA</em>, an allele frequency of <em>a</em> is $$(2 \times 50) + 25 = 125, \frac{125}{200}=62.5%$$
an allele frequency of <em>A</em> is
$$25 + (2 \times 25) = 75, \frac{75}{200}=37.5%$$
Note that the denominator is $200$ as pea plant is diploid</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measurments-of-genotype-and-allele-frequencies">Measurments of Genotype and Allele Frequencies</h3>
<h4 id="observable-traits">Observable Traits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Measurment through observable traits is possible if phenotype = genotype</li>
<li>Rarely observed due to large number of encoding genes for a trait and because not only genotypes, but also environment affects phenotypes</li>
<li>Until 1960s, we were only able to study phenotypes that are encoded by a single gene e.g. ABO blood group, colouring of two-spot ladybug <em>Adalia bipuncatata</em>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gel Electrophoresis</strong> separates segments of proteins according to their charge and their size</li>
<li>An individual with <strong>heterozygotic</strong> mutation that eventually alters a protein will produce two distinct bands in the gel</li>
<li>Limiation: can detect only mutations that alter protein structures</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-is-evolution-1">What is Evolution?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution</strong> is a change in the frequency of an allele or a genotype throughout generations. Note evolution can occur without a change in allele frequency if genotype frequency changes
<blockquote>
<p>Populations evolve, not individuals</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardy-weignberg-equilibrium">Hardy-Weignberg Equilibrium</h3>
<h4 id="when-does-evolution-come-to-halt">When does evolution come to halt?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changes do not occur once <strong>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</strong> is reached</li>
<li><strong>Hardy-Weignberg equilibrium</strong> specifies the relationship between <a href="#allele-frequency" >alleleFrequencies</a>
 and <a href="#genotype-frequency" >genotypeFrequencies</a>
 when the following conditions are met:
<ol>
<li><strong>No Nautral Selection</strong>: No difference in the survival and reproductive success of individuals with different genotypes e.g. Given <em>a</em> is a <a href="#lethal" >lethal</a>
 recessive mutation, all <em>aa</em> individuals will die -&gt; decrease in frequency of <em>a</em> allele -&gt; increase in frequency of <em>A</em> allele, representing the survival success</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Population</strong>: this equilibrium holds only for infinitely large populations to neglect <a href="#genetic-drift" >genetic</a>
 <a href="#genetic-drift" >drift</a>
</li>
<li><strong>No Gene Flow</strong>: Populations are not added to or subtracted from by migration</li>
<li><strong>No Mutations</strong>: e.g. If <em>A</em> alleles mutate into <em>a</em> alleles, there still exist changes in genetic makeup</li>
<li><strong>Indiscriminate Mating</strong>: mate choice made regardless of genotype</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hardy-weignberg-principle">Hardy-Weignberg Principle</h4>
<ul>
<li>To ask whether a population is evolving, we can first determine what the genetic makeup of the population would look like if it were not evolving at that locus</li>
<li><strong>Null model</strong> can be compared with a real population

<h4 id="example-of-genotype-frequencies">Example of genotype frequencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis: <strong>Hardy-Weinberg equillibrium</strong> has met</li>
<li>Consider 70 <em>A</em> alleles and 30 <em>a</em> alleles. Then,
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{AA homozygote})=0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49$$
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{Aa heterozygote})=(0.7 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7)=0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42$$
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{aa homozyote})=0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$$</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="generalization-of-frequency-prediction">Generalization of frequency prediction</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppose Hardy-Weignberg conditions are met (no change in allele and genotype frequencies). Let</p>
<ul>
<li>$p=\text{frequency of } A$</li>
<li>$q=\text{frequency of } a$</li>
<li>$p+q=1$ (normalization)
<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Hardy-Weignberg.png" alt="hardy-weignberg-equillibrium-frequencies"  />
</p>

Then we can predict the genotype frequencies in the next generation as the following:
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{AA})=p^2$$
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{Aa})=2pq$$
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{aa})=q^2$$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if Hardy-Weignberg conditions are not met, allele frequencies can be determined given genotype frequencies e.g. $\text{frequency of }A=p=\sqrt{p^2}=\sqrt{\mathbb{P}(AA)}$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="significance-of-hardy-weignberg-equillibrium">Significance of Hardy-Weignberg equillibrium</h4>
<ul>
<li>When it is upheld, it provides a means of converting between allele and genotype frequencies</li>
<li>When it is not upheld, we can infer that evolution has occured in that population (further investigation is required to find the mechanism behind it)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-selection">Natural Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deterious mutations are eliminated and have no long-term evolutionary impact</li>

<h4 id="what-is-fitness">What is Fitness?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fitness</strong> is a <strong>relative</strong> measure of the ability of an individual to survive and reproduct in a particular environment</li>
<li>i.e. the extent to which the individual&rsquo;s genotype is represented in the next generation</li>
<li>e.g. Consider a gazelle that runs 25 kph. In a <a href="#herd" >herd</a>

<h3 id="types-of-natural-selections">Types of Natural Selections</h3>
<h4 id="positive-vs-negative">Positive vs Negative</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Selection</strong>: natural selection that increases the frequency of an advantegous allele</li>
<li><strong>Negative Selection</strong>: natural selection that decreases the frequency of a deletrious allele</li>
<li>Human genetic disease still arises as recessive alleles are not completely eliminated through natural selection</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="balancing-selection">Balancing Selection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balancing Selection</strong>: natural selection that acts to maintain two or more alleles of a given gene in a population</li>
<li>e.g. <a href="#heterozygote-advantage" >heterozygote</a>
 <a href="#heterozygote-advantage" >advantage</a>
 illustrated by human populations in Africa affected by malaria: a heterozygote <em>AS</em> with <em>A</em>, a normal hemoglobin allele and <em>S</em>, a sickle-cell allele is preferred as sickle-cells are effective at fighting for malaria but also can be fatal if excessive due to capillary blockage</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="modes-of-selection">Modes of Selection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stabilizing Selection</strong>: maintains the status quo and acts against extremes e.g. human birth weight: fatal if a baby is very small or very big
<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Stabilizing_selection.png" alt="stabilizingSelection"  />

<p class="imgp">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./Directional_selection.png" alt="directionalSelection"  />
</p>

<strong>Artificial Selection</strong> is a form of directional selection</li>
<li><strong>Disruptive Selection</strong>: a form of selection that operates in favour of extremes and against intermediate forms, selecting against the mean e.g. Apple maggot flies (<em>Rhagoletis pomonella</em>): one group feeds on apple trees, the other group on hawthorn trees due to the difference in the timing of fruiting

Basic Definition:\nChange through time Decent with motification Darwin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Pangenesis\u0026rdquo;: proposal that each part of the body continually emits small particles called gemmules that contribute to the heritable information to the gametes Biological Definition:\nChange in allele or genotype frequencies in populations over time Note:\nEvolution occurs in populations Evolution does not occur in an individual Adaptive Radiation Organism diversify rapidly from an acestral species when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niche e.g. Hawaiian Drosophila radiation: alleles and genotypes of Drosophila shift through times as volcanic islands form, are observed through phenotypes, and evolve by natural selection How does Evolution affect our lives? Penicillin\nProduct of Penicillium mold (Alexander Fleming, 1928) Represents an evolved response to bacteria First antibiotic drug based on a naturally occuring substance Four years of of use -\u0026gt; Staphylococcus strains resistant went up to 14% By 1950, resistant became more than 50% Penicillin: today\nContinue to develop new strains of penicillin Identify and locate resistance Need to minimize dependence on antibiotics Resistant bacteria still kills 30,000 to 40,000 Americans each year COVID-19\nMutations lead to variations, which can exceptionally be problematic Properties of variants: virulence , dispersal, symptoms Micro vs Macro Microevolution\nChanges within a species Caused by natural selection or evolutionary forces Depends on heritable variation in genetics of a population Traits can be under strong natural selection e.g. antibiotic resistance Macroevolution\nChanges between species Microevolution Phenotypic Variation Heritable variation in appearance and/or function\nQualitative variation:\nDiscrete characteristics Polymorphism: distinct variatns of character e.g. two-spot ladybug Quantitative variation:\nContinuous and measurable characteristics Controlled by multiple genes e.g. height Examples of Phenotypic Variation\nEuropean Garden Snails vary in colour as there is no selective pressure acting on it. In a hypothetical situation, the population can converge towards a brown-coloured snails if the predators evolve to detect the bright colours better. Bahamian Land Snails are under a strong selective pressure, having only a few, non-distinguishable phenotypic variation. Factors of the Phenotypic Variation\nPhenotypic variation is due to genetics (genotype), environment, or both Only genetic component of phenotype are heritable Phenotypic Variation Experiment Keep Genetics constant (e.g. clone), Vary Environment The clour of Hydrangeas vary depending on the pH of soil (acidic: blue, basic: pink) Breeding and Selection Important as evolution can only act on heritable variation Artificially selected mouse with higher activity level (experimental lines) and compared with control lines (no artificial selection) -\u0026gt; found out that there was underlying genetic variation for activity level Mandelian genetics Genetic Variation Causes\nNew alleles from mutations Recombination: from crossing over, independent assortment, random fertilization Types\nGerm-line mutations: occur in the reproductive cells -\u0026gt; inherited Somatic mutations: occur in the non-reproductive cells -\u0026gt; does not get inherited Population Genetics The study of patterns in genetic variation in populations\nIndividuals within a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur Individuals within a population are closely related to each other than members of other populations Different populations of the same species may be isolated from each other such that gene flow is rare Gene Pool\nSum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population Characterizes a population\u0026rsquo;s genetic makeup Used to identify the genotypes and calculate genotype frequencies Given that species is diploids and have two alleles of each gene, we can calculate allele frequencies Evolutionary Agents Genotypes and Alleles Genotype frequency: the % of individuals in a population with a specific genotype -\u0026gt; shows the distribution of allele combinations in a population Allele frequency: the % of all copies of a certain gene in a population that carry a specific allele -\u0026gt; shows the distribution of genetic variation in a population Evolution is measured as changes in allele frequencies in populations Computing Frequencies Notations $$p=\\text{frequency of one allele}$$ $$q=\\text{frequency of another allele}$$ $$p+q=1 \\text{ (normalization)}$$\nGenotype Frequencies of the Next Genetation\nAssuming that the population is in equilibrium for the C locus, we have $$(p+q)\\times(p+q)=p^2+2pq+q^2$$ where $$p^2= (\\text{frequency of }C^RC^R)$$ $$2pq= (\\text{frequency of }C^RC^W)$$ $$q^2= (\\text{frequency of }C^WC^W)$$\nExample\nConisder Snapdragons that exhibit incomplete dominance with distinctive phenotype of heterozygotes Let $p=0.7, q=0.3$ Then, expected genotype frequencies in the next generation are $$p^2= 0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.49$$ $$2pq= 2 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.42$$ $$q^2= 0.3 \\times 0.3 = 0.09$$ Predicted countings are 490, 420, and 90. Actual countings are 410, 423, and 167, respectively Thus, we can conclude that one of the Hardy-Weinberg principles is violated and the population is evolving with the selective force towards the $C^W$ allele. The Hardy-Weinberg Principle Null model: assume the absence of evolutionary change and compare it to the real population Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: describes a population where the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remains constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mandelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium occurs when the following conditions are met: No mutation No gene flow: population is closed to migration from other populations Infinite population No natural selection: all genotypes survive and reproduce equally Random mating: individuals mate randomly with respect to genotypes Microevolutionary Agents Mutation: a heritable change in DNA -\u0026gt; introduces new genetic variation into population Rare event, significant over long time scales Deleterious or lethal mutations are harmful but may persist if recessive Neutral mutations are neither harmful or helpful e.g. slient mutation that does not alter amino acids Advantageous mutations benefit an organism e.g. novel host adaptation Gene flow: change in allele frequencies as individuals join a population and reproduce -\u0026gt; may introduce genetic variation from another population may be the movement of individuals e.g. seeds or gametes e.g. pollen Genetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies caused by chance events -\u0026gt; reduces genetic variation (can eliminate in small populations) Population bottelneck: caused by catastrophic factors: diseases, starvation, drought -\u0026gt; reduce genetic variation Founders effect: migrating population may not have the entire genetic variation of the parent population Natural selection: differential survivorship or reproduction of individuals with different genotypes -\u0026gt; one allele may increase in frequency Relative fitness is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contribution of others Natural selection can be measured by fitness Directional selection: favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum Stabilizing selection: favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes Disruptive selection: favours individuals with extreme phenotypes Nonrandom mating: choice of mates based on their phenotypes and genotypes -\u0026gt; does not directly affect allele frequencies but prevent genetic equilibrium Variation in Populations Why is Variation Beneficial for Evolution? Variation in populations plays a key role in natural selection Natural seletion depicts that the variants with characteristics that are best applicable for an environment in terms of growth and reproduction will contribute the most to the next generation. e.g. Farmers choosing seeds with high yield and resistency to drought and disease Breeders developing different breeds of dogs e.g. terriors, huskies (Selection under domestication) Rise in antibiotic resistance of disease-causing microorganisms How does Variation Occur? Environmental Selection Occurs due to differences in the environment e.g. Exposure to sunlight Exposure to female codling moth (its egg develops into a caterpillar and eats its way into the fruit) Genetic Variation Occurs due to differences in the genetic material e.g. Types of apples with different tastes and color (green Granny Smith, yellow Golden Delicious, scarlet Red Delicious) Individual apples within a tree (due to unique combinations of genes through fertilizaion process) Stems from genetic mutations Mutations arise from: Random errors when passing genetic materials i.e. during DNA replication Environmental factors e.g. UV radiation, cigarette smoke Harmful variations die out overtime Beneficial veriations thrive Neither can persist overtime Evolutionary Trees Evolution can be illustrated using a tree diagram as following. Branches represent different groups or organisms and nodes indicate the most recent common ancestor Tree of Life: the full set of evolutionary relationships along all organisms Most branches on the tree of life consist of microorganisms Despite that the tree shows the origin of eukarya to be archaea, biologists think it is derived by symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium The order of life-forms is determined by fossils Evolution through Experiments Can Evolution be Demonstrated in the Laboratory? Background: In 1988, the biologist Richard Lenski grew E.Coli on a medium with imited amounts of glucose to observe whether they improve on their ability to metabolize glucose.\nHypothesis: Any bacterium wiht a random mutation that increases its ability to take up glucose will reproduct at a faster rate than the other, thereby demonstrating evolution in a bacterial population.\nExperiment: Cells of E.Coli are frozen at -80°C are kept suspended in animation, surviving without any biological processes. Starting bacteria are labeled Ancestral and the bacterial populations taken from the environment with limiting amounts, every 500 generations, of glucose were labeled Descendant. Then, compared the rate of growth of these two populations.\nResults: The growth rate of the Descendant bacterial populations became much steeper than the rate of the Ancestral in the given environment.\nConclusion: This experiment demonstrates that E.Coli evolved an improved ability to metabolize glucose overtime.\nFollow-up: Later studies discovered differences in genetic makeup between Ancestral and Descendant bacterial populations.\nApplication: Development of beneficial strains of microorganisms. e.g.\nRemoving toxins from lakes and rivers Understand how pathogens develop resistance to drugs Genetic Variation In spite of a high degree of phenotypic variation, humans rank low in terms of overall genetic variation. Humans differ from each other by 1 DNA base per 1000 (99.9% identical), whereas fruit flies differ by 10 DNA bases per 1000 (99% identical).\nNote that both genotype and environment contribute to the phenotype of an individual, which makes it hard for us to compare genetic variation directly. We can achieve this through DNA sequencing.\nPopulation Genetics What is a species? A group of individuals that are capable of sharing alleles Each individual represents different combinations of alleles drawn from the gene pool What is Population Genetics? The study of genetic variation in natural populations This discipline answers the following questions: Which factors determine the amount of variation in a population and in a species? Why are humans genetically less variable than fruit flies? Which factors affect the distribution of particular variations? Sources of Genetic Variation Mutation: generates new alleles\nMutation by effective range\nSomatic mutation: occur in the body\u0026rsquo;s tissues in nonreproductive cells Only affects one individual e.g. skin cancer due to somatic mutation is not inherited Germ-line mutation: occur in the reproductive cells i.g. sperms, eggs Appear in every cell of an offspring Mutation by effects on an organism\nNeutral mutation: despite every human naturally having around 60 new mutations, most of them have little to no effect as a large part of genome consists of noncoding DNA Deleterious mutation: most of mutations occuring in protein-coding regions have a harmful effect Advantageous mutation: delivers a beneficial effect, rarely occurs Recombination: shuffles mutations and generates new permutations, followed by segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic cell division\nMeasuring Genetic Variation The goal of population genetics is to infer the evolutionary process from patterns of genetic variation in nature. Thus, the rates of occurrence of alleles in populations play a key role.\nAllele Frequencies What is Allele Frequency? The allele frequency of an allele x is the number of x\u0026rsquo;s present in the population divided by the total number of alleles e.g. Given 50% aa, 25% Aa, 25% AA, an allele frequency of a is $$(2 \\times 50) + 25 = 125, \\frac{125}{200}=62.5%$$ an allele frequency of A is $$25 + (2 \\times 25) = 75, \\frac{75}{200}=37.5%$$ Note that the denominator is $200$ as pea plant is diploid Measurments of Genotype and Allele Frequencies Observable Traits Measurment through observable traits is possible if phenotype = genotype Rarely observed due to large number of encoding genes for a trait and because not only genotypes, but also environment affects phenotypes Until 1960s, we were only able to study phenotypes that are encoded by a single gene e.g. ABO blood group, colouring of two-spot ladybug Adalia bipuncatata Gel Electrophoresis Gel Electrophoresis separates segments of proteins according to their charge and their size An individual with heterozygotic mutation that eventually alters a protein will produce two distinct bands in the gel Limiation: can detect only mutations that alter protein structures DNA Sequencing Capable to detect silent mutations How to: Collect a population sample Count the number of occurrences of a given mutation e.g. Consider single nucleotide polymorphism Evolution and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Evolution What is Evolution? Evolution is a change in the frequency of an allele or a genotype throughout generations. Note evolution can occur without a change in allele frequency if genotype frequency changes Populations evolve, not individuals\nHardy-Weignberg Equilibrium When does evolution come to halt? Changes do not occur once Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is reached Hardy-Weignberg equilibrium specifies the relationship between alleleFrequencies and genotypeFrequencies when the following conditions are met: No Nautral Selection: No difference in the survival and reproductive success of individuals with different genotypes e.g. Given a is a lethal recessive mutation, all aa individuals will die -\u0026gt; decrease in frequency of a allele -\u0026gt; increase in frequency of A allele, representing the survival success Infinite Population: this equilibrium holds only for infinitely large populations to neglect genetic drift No Gene Flow: Populations are not added to or subtracted from by migration No Mutations: e.g. If A alleles mutate into a alleles, there still exist changes in genetic makeup Indiscriminate Mating: mate choice made regardless of genotype Hardy-Weignberg Principle To ask whether a population is evolving, we can first determine what the genetic makeup of the population would look like if it were not evolving at that locus Null model can be compared with a real population Example of genotype frequencies Hypothesis: Hardy-Weinberg equillibrium has met Consider 70 A alleles and 30 a alleles. Then, $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{AA homozygote})=0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.49$$ $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Aa heterozygote})=(0.7 \\times 0.3) + (0.3 \\times 0.7)=0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42$$ $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{aa homozyote})=0.3 \\times 0.3 = 0.09$$ Generalization of frequency prediction Suppose Hardy-Weignberg conditions are met (no change in allele and genotype frequencies). Let\n$p=\\text{frequency of } A$ $q=\\text{frequency of } a$ $p+q=1$ (normalization) Then we can predict the genotype frequencies in the next generation as the following: $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{AA})=p^2$$ $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Aa})=2pq$$ $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{aa})=q^2$$ Even if Hardy-Weignberg conditions are not met, allele frequencies can be determined given genotype frequencies e.g. $\\text{frequency of }A=p=\\sqrt{p^2}=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{P}(AA)}$\nSignificance of Hardy-Weignberg equillibrium When it is upheld, it provides a means of converting between allele and genotype frequencies When it is not upheld, we can infer that evolution has occured in that population (further investigation is required to find the mechanism behind it) Natural Selection Deterious mutations are eliminated and have no long-term evolutionary impact Advantageous mutations result in adaptation to the environment over time Adaptation Relation between Adaptation and Natural Selection Darwin explained adaptation through natural selection Through On the Origin of Species in 1859 by Darwin brought both evolution and natural selection to public attention Fitness What is Fitness? Fitness is a relative measure of the ability of an individual to survive and reproduct in a particular environment i.e. the extent to which the individual\u0026rsquo;s genotype is represented in the next generation e.g. Consider a gazelle that runs 25 kph. In a herd of gazelle with 20 kph, this one has a high fitness. In a herd of gazelle with 30 kph, this one has low fitness. Relation between Fitness and Natural Selection Natural selection over generations increases the overall fitness of a population Types of Natural Selections Positive vs Negative Positive Selection: natural selection that increases the frequency of an advantegous allele Negative Selection: natural selection that decreases the frequency of a deletrious allele Human genetic disease still arises as recessive alleles are not completely eliminated through natural selection Balancing Selection Balancing Selection: natural selection that acts to maintain two or more alleles of a given gene in a population e.g. heterozygote advantage illustrated by human populations in Africa affected by malaria: a heterozygote AS with A, a normal hemoglobin allele and S, a sickle-cell allele is preferred as sickle-cells are effective at fighting for malaria but also can be fatal if excessive due to capillary blockage Modes of Selection Stabilizing Selection: maintains the status quo and acts against extremes e.g. human birth weight: fatal if a baby is very small or very big Directional Selection: a form of selection that results in a shift of the mean value of a trait in a population over time e.g. size of bills of the birds Artificial Selection is a form of directional selection Disruptive Selection: a form of selection that operates in favour of extremes and against intermediate forms, selecting against the mean e.g. Apple maggot flies (Rhagoletis pomonella): one group feeds on apple trees, the other group on hawthorn trees due to the difference in the timing of fruiting Sexual Selection Sexual Selection: a form of selection that promotes traits that increase an individual\u0026rsquo;s access to reproductive opportunities Intrasexual Selection: a form of sexual selection involving interactions between individuals of on sex e.g fighting ability in males to compete other males Intersexual Selection: a form of sexual selection involving interaction between males and females e.g. bright colors in males to attract females Terminologies niche: the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of the species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem\nvirulence: the quality of being poisonous or injurious to life\npopulation: individuals of species at same time and same place, interbreed, producing fertile offspring\ngene pool: all the alleles present in all individuals in a population or in a species e.g. alleles for skin colour, hair type, eye colour, etc\npopulations: all the individuals of a given species that live and reproduce in the same geograhpical area; one of several interbreeding groups of organisms of the same species living in the same geographical area\npolymorphism: variable nucleotide positions\nlethal: sufficient to cause death\ngenetic drift: a random change in the frequency of an allele due to the statistical effects of finite population size\nallele frequency: commonndess or rarity of each allele in the gene pool assuming individuals are diploid and both gametes contribute to the production of offspring\nherd: a social group of certain animals of the same species\nheterozygote advantage: a form of balancing selection in which the heterozygote\u0026rsquo;s fitness is higher than that of either of the homozygotes resulting in selection that ensures that both alleles remain in the population at intermediate frequencies\n",
